  <h1>Querypoint Demo with knockout</h1>
  <p>Users of this Web page are complaining: the button does not count the number of clicks correctly. 
  Can you find the bug? 
  Start on line 22 of <code>demo.js</code>
  and only use Querypoint debugging.  
  Don't read all of the source, imagine this program was many thousands 
  of lines and you are paid by the number of bugs you find.</p>
