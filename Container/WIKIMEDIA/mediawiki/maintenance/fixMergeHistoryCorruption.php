 * Maintenance script that clears rows of pages corrupted by MergeHistory, those

 * These pages are completely inacessible via the UI due to revision/title mismatch
 * exceptions in RevisionStore and elsewhere.
 *
 * These are rows in page_table that have 'page_latest' entry with corresponding
 * 'rev_id' but no associated 'rev_page' entry in revision table. Such rows create
 * ghost pages because their 'page_latest' is actually living on different pages
 * (which possess the associated 'rev_page' on revision table now).
