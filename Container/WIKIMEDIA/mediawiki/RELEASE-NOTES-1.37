=== Breaking changes in 1.37 ===
* The Revision class, hard deprecated in 1.35, was removed entirely. As
  part of this, the following hooks that included a Revision object
  were removed:
  - ArticleRevisionUndeleted - use RevisionUndeleted
  - ArticleRollbackComplete - use RollbackComplete
  - DiffRevisionTools - use DiffTools
  - DiffViewHeader - use DifferenceEngineViewHeader
  - HistoryRevisionTools - use HistoryTools
  - NewRevisionFromEditComplete - use RevisionFromEditComplete
  - PageContentInsertComplete - use PageSaveComplete

  - TitleMoveComplete - use PageMoveComplete
  - TitleMoveCompleting - use PageMoveCompleting

  - UserRetrieveNewTalks - no replacement
  and the following methods and variables have been removed
  - Article::$mRevision
  - Article::getRevisionFetched()
  - ContribsPager::tryToCreateValidRevision()
  - EditPage::$mBaseRevision
  - EditPage::getBaseRevision()

  - WikiPage::updateIfNewerOn()
  and the following methods no longer accept Revision objects as parameters:
  - CategoryMembershipChange::__construct
  - ContentHandler::getUndoContent
  - DerivedPageDataUpdater::prepareUpdate
  - DifferenceEngine::getRevisionHeader
  - Linker::buildRollbackLink

  - WikiPage::doDeleteUpdates
  - WikiPage::doEditUpdates
  - WikiPage::hasDifferencesOutsideMainSlot
  - WikiPage::onArticleEdit
  - WikiPage::prepareContentForEdit
  - WikiPage::updateRevisionOn
  The following methods return arrays that formerly included a 'revision'
  key that would emit deprecation warnings when accessed and return a
  Revision object. The Revision object has been removed from the arrays,
  and the 'revision-record' key should be used to get the relevant
  RevisionRecord instead:
  - PageUpdater::doCreate
  - PageUpdater::doModify
  - Parser::statelessFetchTemplate
  The ParserOptions `templateCallback` option is a callback that is called
  in Parser::fetchTemplateAndTitle() and should return an array - the
  'revision' key to that array used to be a Revision object and was used if
  no 'revision-record' was returned - it is now ignored.
* Previously, the classes RevisionTestModifyableContent and
  RevisionTestModifyableContentHandler were loaded for use in tests, but
  were only used within the tests for the since-removed Revision class. This
  content and content handler class were removed without deprecation.
* WANObjectCache::HOLDOFF_NONE, deprecated since 1.35, was removed.
  Use HOLDOFF_TTL_NONE instead.
* LocalFile::recordUpload2(), deprecated since 1.35, was removed.
* The following methods and fields in the Language class, deprecated since
  1.35, have been removed:
   - classFromCode()

   - findVariantLink()
   - mConverter
   - updateConversionTable()
* The following methods in the Parser class have been removed after having
  been deprecated in 1.35:
   - fetchCurrentRevisionOfTitle()
   - statelessFetchRevision()
   - fetchTemplate()
   - Title()
* (T273354) When an edit is prevented by an 'EditFilterMergedContent' hook
  handler without changing the status, the edit form will now be displayed.
* User::clearNotification() which had been deprecated in 1.35 has been removed.
  Use WatchlistManager::clearTitleUserNotification() instead.
* User::getNewtalk() which had been deprecated in 1.35 has been removed. Use
  TalkPageNotificationManager::userHasNewMessages() instead.
* Autopromote class, deprecated since 1.35, was removed. Use
  UserGroupManager instead.
* The following classes, hard-deprecated since 1.36, have been removed:
  CachedAction, SpecialCachedPage, CacheHelper, ICacheHelper.
* The hooks BeforeHttpsRedirect, CanIPUseHTTPS and UserRequiresHTTPS, deprecated
  in 1.35, were removed.
* The TitleArrayFromResult hook, deprecated in 1.36, was removed.
* The deprecated "es6-promise" alias ResourceLoader module has been removed. Use
  "es6-polyfills" directly intead.
* AuthenticationProvider interface doesn't extend LoggerAwareInterface.
  So AuthenticationProvider can't be typehinted as LoggerAwareInterface.
* The following methods, deprecated in 1.35, were removed:
  - Parser::fetchCurrentRevisionOfTitle
  - Parser::statelessFetchRevision
  - Parser::getRevisionObject
  - ParserOptions::getCurrentRevisionCallback
  - ParserOptions::setCurrentRevisionCallback
* User::getGrantName(), hard deprecated since 1.36, has been removed.

  - ApiBase::explodeMultiValue

  - ApiBase::validateLimit
  - ApiBase::validateTimestamp
* User::idCacheByName public static field was removed without deprecation.
  instead of using it, get a UserIdentity by name from UserIdentityLookup.
* IDatabase::upsert() and IDatabase::replace() only accept a single unique key.
  Previously, a warning was issued if there were multiple unique keys provided.
* The MediaWiki:Autoblock_whitelist block exemption control was moved in 1.36 to
  MediaWiki:Block-autoblock-exemptionlist. The backward-compatibility of reading
  the old MediaWiki:Autoblock_whitelist page has now been dropped.

  - use-filebackend => PHPUNIT_USE_FILEBACKEND
  - use-bagostuff => PHPUNIT_USE_BAGOSTUFF
  - use-jobqueue => PHPUNIT_USE_JOBQUEUE
  This is so that we can use the default PHPUnit entry point (T90875).
* The PHPUNIT_REUSE_DB / --reuse-db option was removed from the phpunit.php
  runner. It had been broken for at least three years already. The original use
  case was speeding up tests on Oracle, but Oracle support was dropped several
  releases ago.

  not much benefit in customising the error message.
