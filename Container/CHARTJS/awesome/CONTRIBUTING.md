# Contributing to Awesome Chart.js

Please ensure your contribution adheres to the following guidelines:

## General Guidelines

- **Only suggest packages compatible with Chart.js v2+**
- **If you just created something, wait at least 30 days before submitting.** This is to give it some time to mature and ensure it's not just a publish-and-forget type of project.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Only submit something _unique and generally useful_.
- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, please explain how you feel yours is better.
- Additions should be added in alphabetical order to the relevant section.
- Link to the GitHub (GitLab, BitBucket, etc.) repository, not npmjs.com. Submissions without a repository will not be accepted.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

## Link Guidelines

- Use the following format for adding links: `[package-name](link) - Description.`
- Don't mention `Chart.js` in the description as it's implied.
- Don't prefix packages with `chartjs-*-` as it's implied.
- Start the description with a capital letter.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Descriptions should resemble the repository description.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestion!

## Updating your PR

Many times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.
