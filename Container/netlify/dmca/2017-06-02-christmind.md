I serve on the Board of Directors for the Shanti Christo Foundation. We publish and sell a book, along with its associated audio, called The Way of Mastery, for which we have U.S. copyright registration numbers TXu001204162, TX0007115907 and TX0007701087. This book, along with its associated audio, is made up of three parts titled The Way of the Heart, The Way of Transformation, and The Way of Knowing, that we also sell individually and is copyright under registration number TX0006050954.

In addition, we produce and sell a series of audio CDs and MP3s, on which we claim copyright, and are titled as follows:

 * The Blessing (of Forgiveness)
 * Heaven on Earth
 * Mastering Communication
 * Death and Earth Changes
 * Grace as Reality
 * The Holy Instant
 * Choose to See
 * Ignorance is Bliss

We sell these books and audio products mainly through our on-line store at: http://www.shantichristostore.com/ and through Amazon at https://www.amazon.com/Way-Mastery-Shanti-Christo-Foundation/dp/0977163202.

We contacted the owner of the infringing website via email, and asked him to immediately remove our copyrighted content from his website. He responded that he does not want to comply with our request, even though he did not dispute that we are the copyright owner. At this point, we simply want him to remove all of our copyrighted material from his website.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Board Secretary

Shanti Christo Foundation
