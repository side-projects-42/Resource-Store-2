I have read and understand Netlify's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Someone has obtained a similar URL to our own website (ours: www.meetcortex.com, his: www.cortexautomation.xyz and www.meetcortex.xyz) and is pretending to be our company and using our actual copyright. This is being hosted with Netlify. You can see that the sites in quotation is using our logo and our content.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
