# Intro To Capybara

## Overview

In this lesson, we'll discuss integration testing with Capybara.

## Objectives

1.  Define an integration test and compare it to unit and controller tests.
2.  Use Capybara for integration tests by including it in the testing environment.
3.  Use the Capybara methods `visit` and `page` when writing tests.
4.  Read a Capybara test of response HTML.
5.  Read a Capybara test that interacts with HTML.
6.  Read a Capybara test that submits an HTML form.

## The MVC Framework

There are three basic levels of testing that correspond to the different levels
of our application stack in Model-View-Controller architecture.

![Web Application Stack and Tests](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/k2ypcn86btb6ajo/2015-09-29%20at%204.14%20PM.png)

**Database:** Databases persist or save data from our application.

**Models:** Models provide an object-oriented abstraction or metaphor for the
data in our application. Our models do the job of interacting with the database
for us. Our model can talk to the database by asking for certain data and using
that data to create a new instance of our class. We can then interact with that
data by using the methods and properties of the instance of that class.

**Controllers:** Controllers provide the main interface and application logic.
They deal with things like: "What data should I show a user in response to
certain input from that user" or "What HTML should be sent to the user when they
visit the /about page?". In large scale MVC applications, controllers are
represented by classes, but really, lots of `bin` files could be considered
controllers.

**Views:** Views present information to the user. Any code that is responsible
for presenting data or output to the user, from methods that use a bunch of
`puts`, to HTML, to ERB templates, could be considered a View. In web
applications, Views are generally represented by ERB templates that generate
HTML.

**User/Browser:** The top of our application pyramid is finally the user.
Whether describing the people using our application, the interface they use such
as a Command Line, Voice, or HTML, or the program they use to even access our
application, such as a Browser like Chrome or Safari, or a Native app, our
application is responsible for delivering the user an experience on some sort of
pre-existing platform.

#### Basic MVC Flow

Let's take a look at how it all fits together. We'll use an example of a social
networking application.

1.  The user interacts with our application's view(s) via the command line or a
    web browser. The user enters some input that asks our application to show them a
    list of all of their friends who are using the application.
2.  The controller receives this request and looks at it. The controller says,
    "Okay, this user wants to see a list of their friends."
3.  The controller then asks the `Friend` model to go into the database and
    return all of the user's friends.
4.  The model goes to the database, retrieves all of the requested data, and
    gives it to the controller.
5.  The controller passes that data to a view, and the view displays it to the
    user.

## The Three Levels of Testing

Refer to the graphic. Each MVC layer is associated with a type of test: Models
to Unit; Controllers to Controller; Views to Integration. Just as the MVC layers
higher up make use of the MVC layers lower down the pyramid, testing at higher
layers will also "exercise" or "flex" the layers lower down. Consider that if
you want to test a user's perspective by browsing to a page and performing some
action (say, subscribing to a newsletter) you're going to test views ("Is there
a field for adding my email address?") )_explicitly_, but _also_ implicitly test
the Controller ("Did my submit button click POST to `subscribers#create`") as
well as the Model ("Is the number of `Subscriber` instances 1 larger than it was
_before_ I made this request?")

### Unit Tests

Unit tests test the models in our application and how they interact with our
database.

### Controller Tests

Controller tests test that the code responsible for delivering the appropriate
data to a user is working properly. In a web app, a controller test is
responsible for making sure that an HTTP request returns the expected HTTP
response. Controller tests should test not HTML or forms but, rather, that the
controller is behaving as expected.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are the highest-level test, and they are closest to describing
how a user will actually interact with our application. Commonly referred to as
'End-to-End' tests, integration tests should flex your entire application stack
(i.e., all of the MVC components) and rarely isolate components or behaviors.
They are perfect for spec'ing high level user interactions with HTML and forms.
We're going to be learning how to write and read an integration test using a
library called Capybara within an RSpec test suite.

_Note: While you will generally not be required to write tests in Learn, you
will be required to read a test and understand what functionality the test suite
is anticipating and testing. If you can read a test, we believe you can also
write a test._

## Integration Testing with Capybara

### What is Capybara?

Capybara is a library of code that we can include in our application via the
Capybara gem. The Capybara library allows us to write code that simulates how a
user interacts with our app. We can write such code in our integration tests and
thus test the functionality of our application.

### Capybara Setup

To use Capybara for integration tests in Rails or Sinatra, we need to include it
in our testing environment. In our `spec/spec_helper.rb` file, we add the
following code:

```ruby
# Load RSpec and Capybara
require 'rspec'
require 'capybara/rspec'
require 'capybara/dsl'

# Configure RSpec
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # Mixin the Capybara functionality into Rspec
  config.include Capybara::DSL
  config.order = 'default'
end

# Define the application we're testing
def app
  # Load the application defined in config.ru
  Rack::Builder.parse_file('config.ru').first
end

# Configure Capybara to test against the application above.
Capybara.app = app
```

The above code might look long and confusing. All you need to know is that it is
configuring `RSpec` and our tests to be able to use all the wonderful methods
and interactions Capybara provides.

The most important part of the configuration is the last line where we
explicitly tell `Capybara` that the `app` we're testing against is defined in
`config.ru`.

## Our Application

Consider a simple web application that shows the user a form asking for their
name. When the user submits the form, the application will greet the user based
on the name they provided.

Our homepage, at `'/'`, will display the form:

![Form](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1zocl86jv9qguth/2015-09-29%20at%206.00%20PM%20%281%29.png)

Upon submitting the form, the application sends a `POST` request to the
`POST '/greet'` route. Then, the user should see the following page:

![Response](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/83o4onopkwquuve/2015-09-29%20at%206.01%20PM.png)

Colloquially we could express the tests for this application as follows:

```
When a user visits '/'
  they should see a greeting
  they should see a form with a name field

When a user submits the greeting form
  they should fill in the name with "Avi"
  they should click submit
  they should see "Hi Avi, it's nice to meet you!"
```

It is exactly these sorts of behaviors, conditions, and expectations that
Capybara makes very easy to describe and test.

## Testing our Application

Now that our test suite is set up to use Capybara, let's start writing some
tests for our application.

### `GET '/'`

We want our root path to show our greeting form:

![Form](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1zocl86jv9qguth/2015-09-29%20at%206.00%20PM%20%281%29.png)

We want to have a test that checks that the `get '/'` route brings the user
to that page.

Look at this test in `spec/application_integration_spec.rb`.

File: `spec/application_integration_spec.rb`

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe "GET '/' - Greeting Form" do
  it 'welcomes the user' do
    visit '/'
    expect(page.body).to include("Welcome!")
  end
end
```

Most of that code is actually vanilla RSpec. Capybara provides two new methods,
`visit` and `page`.

#### Capybara `visit`

The `visit` method navigates the test's browser to a specific URL. It is
equivalent to a user typing a URL into their browser's location bar. The
argument it accepts is a string for the URL you want to test. Since we want to
test our `'/'` root URL, we say `visit '/'`, and Capybara will load that page
within our test.

#### Capybara `page`

The `page` method in Capybara exposes the "session" or "browser" that is
conceptually (and literally) being used during the test. The `page` method gives
you a `Capybara::Session` object that represents the browser page the user would
actually be looking at if they navigated to `'/'` (or whichever route was last
passed to `visit`).

As such, `page` responds to a lot of methods that represent actions a user could
take on a page, such as `click_link`, `fill_in`, and `body`.

The `page.body` method will dump out all of the HTML in the current page as a
string.

Our test is telling Capybara to visit the `/` URL. It then sets the expectation
that the body of the page returned should include at least the text `Welcome!`
somewhere.

### Passing the First Test

File: `./config.ru`

```ruby
require 'sinatra'

require_relative './app'

run Application
```

In a basic application like this example, our `config.ru` `require`s the
`sinatra` gem. It then `require_relative`s the required file `app.rb` that
defines our main `Application` controller. Finally, we `run` our `Application`
controller to start our web application. When we run `shotgun`, the gem will
look for a `config.ru` file if no other file is specified. This file acts as the
entry point for starting up your application.

File: `./app.rb`

```ruby
class Application < Sinatra::Base
  get '/' do
    erb :index
  end
end
```

`./app.rb` is our main application file, defining the controller that will power
this web application. We create an `Application` class and inherit from
`Sinatra::Base` to give it all of the web superpowers needed to transform the
standard Ruby class into a Sinatra controller.

Within our `Application` controller, we use the Sinatra DSL to create a `GET`
route at the `/` URL. We tell our application to respond to `HTTP GET` requests
to `/` by rendering the designated ERB template or HTML.

The line `erb :index` tells the application to render, or deliver to the user's
browser, the file in `views/index.erb`. This is a Sinatra-provided functionality
that renders ERB templates located in the `views` directory. Let's look at that
view file.

File: `views/index.erb`

```erb
<h1>Welcome!</h1>
```

Our ERB file at `views/index.erb` (Sinatra will automatically look for the
`.erb` extension when you call `erb` in the controller) contains the necessary
HTML to make our test pass.

The final piece of the puzzle is a `config.ru` file to put everything together
and start our Sinatra application. This is the file `shotgun` or `rackup` will
read to start your local application server, and it's also the file our test
suite is using to define our application –– remember
`Rack::Builder.parse_file('config.ru').first`?

If we now start our application with `shotgun` and open `http://localhost:9393`
in our browser, we'll see our welcome message.

![Welcome](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/bue5icj3yuz6iol/2015-09-29%20at%208.56%20PM.png)

And when we run our test suite, we'll see:

```
$ rspec

GET '/' - Greeting Form
  welcomes the user

Finished in 0.03438 seconds (files took 0.43261 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
```

_Note: If you're getting an error about conflicting gems, you may need to run
`bundle exec rspec` (or `bundle exec learn`). Prepending a command with `bundle exec` forces your terminal to run the process with the version of the gems
specified in the gem file rather than just using the most recent versions on
your machine. If this still does not fix the error, try `bundle update`_

If you receive an error output, don't worry, read it and see if you can figure
out what's going on and fix it. If not, just move on. **This lesson is about
understanding how to read a Capybara test**; not how to write or debug them.

### Passing the Second Test: Adding the Greeting Form Requirement

Great, step 1, to get a basic test and application working, is done! Let's now
add tests for the HTML form that will allow users to provide their name for the
greeting. When our tests pass, our form at `/` will look like:

![Form](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1zocl86jv9qguth/2015-09-29%20at%206.00%20PM%20%281%29.png)

So let's describe an expectation for that HTML in our test.

Edit: `spec/application_integration_spec.rb`

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe "GET '/' - Greeting Form" do
  # Code from previous example
  it 'welcomes the user' do
    visit '/'
    expect(page.body).to include("Welcome!")
  end

  # New test
  it 'has a greeting form with a user_name field' do
    visit '/'

    expect(page).to have_selector("form")
    expect(page).to have_field(:user_name)
  end
end
```

Our new test has a similar setup to the first test– we tell Capybara to visit
the page at `'/'`. Once that is done, we set some expectations against the
`page` object that represent the user looking at the page in their browser. We
can simply assert that the `page` has an HTML selector for `form`, meaning that
the page contains an HTML element that matches the `form` tag.

Where does this magic `have_selector` matcher come from? That's right, Capybara
has added that to RSpec. Capybara `page` objects respond to methods that relate
intimately to HTML and the DOM (Document Object Model) that defines web
applications. You can literally ask the `page` object: "Hey, do you have HTML
that matches the following selector?" Pretty amazing, right?

The second expectation is similar: `expect(page).to have_field(:user_name)`.
We're saying that we expect the `page` to have a form field called `user_name`.
We get to be even more semantic with the `have_field` matcher, making sure that
the HTML in `page` contains a form input with either an `ID` or `name` attribute
that matches the argument, in this case `:user_name`.

After editing and saving the integration test, running our tests according to
the current code should produce:

```bash
rspec

GET '/' - Greeting Form
  welcomes the user
  has a greeting form with a user_name field (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) GET '/' - Greeting Form has a greeting form with a name field
     Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_selector("form")
       expected #has_selector?("form") to return true, got false
     # ./spec/application_integration_spec.rb:12:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.03963 seconds (files took 0.42466 seconds to load)
2 examples, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/application_integration_spec.rb:9 # GET '/' - Greeting Form has a greeting form with a name field
```

Our first test for welcoming the user still passes, but our new test fails.
Let's zoom in on the meaningful part of the failure message.

```bash
Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_selector("form")
  expected #has_selector?("form") to return true, got false
```

The failure message is telling us that we expected the page to have an HTML form
and it doesn't, so it's failing. Let's add our HTML form to our view and make
this test pass.

Edit: `views/index.erb`

```html
<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<form action="/greet" method="POST">
  <label for="user_name">Name:</label>

  <p><input type="text" name="user_name" id="user_name" /></p>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

Don't worry about the specifics of the HTML form. Just know that it is building
an HTML form that, when submitted, will create an `HTTP POST` request to
`/greet`. The `POST` request will contain whatever the user typed into the
form's `<input>` field, which is nested within the form and has a name value of
`user_name`, matching our Capybara test expectation.

Run your tests now or reload your browser, and you should see the form and your
tests passing.

### `POST '/greet'`

#### Passing the Third Test: Processing the Form and Greeting the User

The final step of our greeting application is to teach our application how to
accept the form that a user submits. We know that we want the outcome to be a
custom greeting message based on what they type into the `user_name` field in
the form. If you typed in `Avi` and clicked submit, we'd expect the page in our
browser to look like:

![Response](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/83o4onopkwquuve/2015-09-29%20at%206.01%20PM.png)

Let's write those tests.

Add the following to the end of the `spec/application_integration_spec.rb` file
(below the closing `end` of the first `describe` block).

```ruby
describe "POST '/greet' - User Greeting" do
  it 'greets the user personally based on their user_name in the form' do
    visit '/'

    fill_in(:user_name, :with => "Avi")
    click_button "Submit"

    expect(page).to have_text("Hi Avi, nice to meet you!")
  end
end
```

This new test is trying to mimic what a user should see when they visit the
greeting form, fill in the name 'Avi', and click the 'Submit' button. Because of
the amazing `RSpec` DSL mixed in with `Capybara`, our test is able to clearly
and simply describe that behavior.

We `visit '/'` to load the form into the `page` object.

Then we use the Capybara method `fill_in` to fill in the input field `user_name`
with 'Avi'.

Finally, we `click_button "Submit"` to submit the form. That HTML interaction,
submitting a form, will trigger a new HTTP request in the Capybara session and
`page` object.

When a user submits a form, the browser loads a new page, and they see new
content. Similarly, when Capybara submits a form, the `page` object is
appropriately updated. `page` no longer contains the original greeting form,
but, rather, after `click_button` is called, `page` now contains the response to
the greeting form.

In response to Capybara's submission of the greeting form, we can `expect` the
`page` to `have_text` `"Hi Avi, nice to meet you!"`. Our test user filled in
their `user_name` as 'Avi', and the resulting greeting should mention that.
`have_text` is another really friendly and semantic Capybara matcher for testing
HTML text value explicitly.

After adding this test, if we run our test suite, we'll see:

```bash
GET '/' - Greeting Form
  welcomes the user
  has a greeting form with a user_name field

POST '/greet' - User Greeting
  greets the user personally based on their user_name in the form (FAILED - 1)

Failures:

  1) POST '/greet' - User Greeting greets the user personally based on their user_name in the form
     Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_text("Hi Avi, nice to meet you!")
       expected #has_text?("Hi Avi, nice to meet you!") to return true, got false
     # ./spec/application_integration_spec.rb:24:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Finished in 0.05962 seconds (files took 0.42668 seconds to load)
3 examples, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./spec/application_integration_spec.rb:18 # POST '/greet' - User Greeting greets the user personally based on their user_name in the form
```

Our first two tests relating to `GET '/'` pass, but our new test is failing.
Zooming in on the failure:

```bash
1) POST '/greet' - User Greeting greets the user personally based on their user_name in the form
   Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_text("Hi Avi, nice to meet you!")
     expected #has_text?("Hi Avi, nice to meet you!") to return true, got false
```

When submitting a `POST` request to `/greet`, if the `user_name` was filled in
with `Avi`, we expected the resulting page to contain the text `"Hi Avi, nice to meet you!"`. Unfortunately, at this point, it does not.

To make this pass we need to add two things. Currently, our Sinatra application
only responds to a single HTTP request type, `GET` requests to `/`. We need to
teach it to respond to `POST` requests to `/greet`. Let's do that.

Edit: `./app.rb`

```ruby
class Application < Sinatra::Base
  # Old route from previous tests
  get '/' do
    erb :index
  end

  # New route to respond to the form submission
  post '/greet' do
    erb :greet
  end
end
```

Using the Sinatra `post` method, we create a response for requests to `POST '/greet'`. That response should be the HTML contained in the `views/greet.erb`
template, just like the HTML response of our first route was contained in
`views/index.erb`.

The next step is to build our view in `views/greet.erb`. The point of this view
is to use the data the user submitted in the previous form within our HTML to
produce a personalized greeting for the user.

File: `views/greet.erb`

```html
<h1>Hi <%= params[:user_name] %>, nice to meet you!</h1>
```

That HTML and ERB will satisfy our test.

If you are unfamiliar with the `params` object and how it relates to form and
inputs, that's totally fine. The TL;DR is that all the information the user
submitted in the form is available to your code within a hash named `params`.
`params[:user_name]` returns the text the user typed into the form input field
`user_name`. `<%= params[:user_name] %>` uses ERB's embedded ruby to dynamically
insert the value of `params[:user_name]` into the HTML of the response.

With this code in place, our tests should pass, and, if we refresh our browser
and submit the form, it should behave as expected.

That's it, you totally crushed Capybara and integration testing.

## Summary

We learned about:

1.  Integration Tests – Tests that exercise the outermost part of our
    application code from the user's perspective, simulating user interactions with
    the application via its interface (in this example, a web browser and HTML).
2.  Capybara – A Ruby library that works with RSpec to allow you to write
    extremely powerful, simple, and semantic integration tests for web applications.
3.  `visit` & `page` – Capybara methods for controlling the test user's browser
    and examining the current state of the page as they 'see' it.
4.  `have_selector`, `have_field`, & `have_text` – Capybara matchers for
    ensuring that the page contains certain matching HTML or text.
5.  `fill_in` & `click_button` – Capybara methods for mimicking user activities,
    such as filling in form fields or clicking buttons.
6.  A simple Sinatra form application with two routes, `GET` and `POST`, and a
    working form that accepts input and sends a dynamic response.

Great job!
