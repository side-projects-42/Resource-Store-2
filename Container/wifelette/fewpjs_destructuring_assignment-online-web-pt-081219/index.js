// 1. Use destructuring to assign appropriate variables based on the sounds animals make.

const farmAnimals = "cow horse sheep pig chicken";

const [moo, neigh, baa, oink, cluck] = farmAnimals.split(" "); // ["cow", "horse", etc.]

// 2. Bolt the horse wandered off, so just give us four animals, and let's name them Bessie, Dolly, Babe, and Little.

const [Bessie, , Dolly, Babe, Little] = farmAnimals.split(" ");

// 3. Little the chicken had to go back to the coop, so now we're left with three. Let's use color variables of black_and_white, black, and pink.

const [black_and_white, , black, pink] = farmAnimals.split(" ");

// Arrays

// 4. Use destructuring to assign appropriate variables using the color names.
const colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"];

const [red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet] = colors;

// 5. Some people have a really hard time picking out indigo, so let's leave that one out, using the first letter of each color as the variable names.

const [r, o, y, g, b, , v] = colors;

// 6. But wait! Indigo is now feeling *super* left out. Let's only assign indigo using indg.

const [, , , , , indg] = colors;

// Objects

// 7. Use destructuring to assign all appropriate variables using the keys as the variable names

const muppet = {
  name: "Kermit",
  color: "green",
  song: "The Rainbow Connection",
  job: "Host of The Muppet Show",
  partner: "Miss Piggy",
};

const { name, color, song, job, partner } = muppet;

// 8. Use destructuring to assign songs 2 and 4, and Kermit's job and partner

const k_muppet = {
  k_name: "Kermit",
  k_color: "green",
  k_album: {
    the_muppet_movie: {
      song_1: "Rainbow Connection",
      song_2: "Moving Right Along",
      song_3: "Never Before, Never Again",
      song_4: "I Hope That Something Better Comes Along",
    },
  },
  k_job: "Host of The Muppet Show",
  k_partner: "Miss Piggy",
};

const { k_color, k_job, k_partner } = k_muppet;
const { song_2, song_4 } = k_muppet.k_album.the_muppet_movie;
