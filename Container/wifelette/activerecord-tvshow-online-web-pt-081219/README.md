## Objectives

1. Create a table using ActiveRecord.
2. Use Active Record's querying methods.

## Overview

In this lab, we'll be working in a TV show domain. We have a TV show model, the
`Show` class, and a `shows` table that you'll create in your database.

You'll be required not only to write a migration that creates a `shows` table
and gives the `Show` class certain attributes, but also to use Active Record's
querying methods.

### Active Record Querying Methods

Active Record makes it easy to ask our database for certain information and
datasets by providing a bunch of built-in methods for us. For example, we can
request the sum of all of the values of a particular column with the `#sum`
method:

```ruby
<class name>.sum(:<column_name>)
```

We can query our database based on certain conditions using the `#where` method.

Let's say we have a `Song` class and table and each song has a `number_of_stars`
rating attribute. We could query for songs with more than 3 stars like this:

```ruby
Song.where("number_of_stars > ?", 3)
```

Let's look at one more example: Let's say we want to query our database for the
lowest value in the `number_of_stars` column, i.e., the lowest rating that any
song has:

```ruby
Song.minimum(:number_of_stars)
```

You'll be writing methods that _rely on Active Record methods like `#minimum`,
`#sum`, and `#where`_ to get these tests passing.

Use the following resources to help you find the Active Record query methods
that will help you pass these tests:

- [Calculations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#calculations)
- [Ordering](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#ordering)
- [Conditions](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#conditions)

## Instructions

### Migration

- Run `mkdir db` and then `mkdir db/migrate` to create the `migrate` folder
  within `db`. Then create a file in the `db/migrate` folder called
  `001_create_shows.rb`. In this file, write the migration code to create a
  `shows` table. The table should have `name`, `network`, `day`, and `rating`
  columns. `name`, `network`, and `day` have a datatype of string, and `rating`
  has a datatype of integer.

- Create an `app` folder with a `models` folder within it, and then create a
  file, `show.rb`, in `app/models`. In this file, you will define a `Show` class
  that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base`.

- Now we need to create a second migration to add another column to our `shows`
  table. In the `db/migrate` folder, create another file,
  `002_add_season_to_shows.rb`, and write a migration to add a column, `season`,
  to the `shows` table. The datatype of this column is string.

**Note**: This lab is using ActiveRecord 5.2. You will need to specify this
version in your migrations by having your classes inherit from
`ActiveRecord::Migration[5.2]`.

### Methods

You'll be defining the following methods:

- `highest_rating`: this method should return the highest value in the ratings
  column. _hint_: if there is a `minimum` Active Record method, might there be a
  `maximum` method?

- `most_popular_show`: this method should return the show with the highest
  rating. _hint_: use the `highest_rating` method as a helper method.

- `lowest_rating`: returns the lowest value in the ratings column.

- `least_popular_show`: returns the show with the lowest rating.

- `ratings_sum`: returns the sum of all of the ratings.

- `popular_shows`: returns an array of all of the shows that have a rating
  greater than `5`. _hint_: use the `where` Active Record method.

- `shows_by_alphabetical_order`: returns an array of all of the shows sorted by
  alphabetical order according to their names. _hint_: use the `order` Active
  Record method.
