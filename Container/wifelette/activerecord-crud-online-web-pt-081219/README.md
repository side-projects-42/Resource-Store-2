# Active Record CRUD

## Objective

The goal of this lab is to get comfortable performing CRUD (Create, Read,
Update, Delete) actions using Active Record.

There are different ways to solve this lab so feel free to experiment!

## Instructions

Before starting this lab run `bundle`, to get the proper gem dependencies. If
your operating system is OSX El Capitan, and you have an issue installing
`EventMachine`, first check to make sure Open SSL is installed by entering `brew install openssl` in terminal. Once it's installed, enter `brew link openssl --force`.

Also enter `rake -T`, which will list all of the rake tasks you have available
in this lab. These tasks come with the `sinatra-activerecord` gem.

Start the lab by running `learn` or keep reading for more instructions.

### Create Table

Try using the rake task `rake db:create_migration NAME=create_movies` to create
your migration file. Once you have a migration file add columns like so:

|Column Name|Type|
|----|-----------|
|`title`|\(string\)|
|`release_date`|\(integer\)|
|`director`|\(string\)|
|`lead`|\(string\)|
|`in_theaters`|\(boolean\)|

After your migration is ready run `rake db:migrate` to
migrate your table and `rake db:migrate SINATRA_ENV=test` to migrate a test
database so you will be able to run `learn`

### Tests

Run `rspec` or `learn` to see the tests. To make them pass open
`movie_controller.rb` and complete each method. It will help to open
`spec/models/movie_spec.rb` to see exactly what each spec is testing for.

In each method the `__` corresponds to a line of code you will need to write to
make the spec pass.

Each test will take us through performing a basic CRUD action using the database
we just created. These tests will take you through:

#### Create

- A movie can be instantiated, given a title, and saved
- A movie can be instantiated with a hash containing all of its attributes
- A movie can be created in a block

#### Read

- You can return the first item in the table
- You can return the last item in the table
- You can return the number of records in the table
- You can return a movie from the table based on its attributes
- You can use a `where` clause to select the appropriate movies and sort them by
  release date

#### Update

- Can be found, updated, and saved
- Can be updated using the `update` method
- Can update all records at once

#### Destroy

- Can destroy a single item
- Can destroy all items at once
