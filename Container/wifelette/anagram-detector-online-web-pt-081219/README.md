# Anagram Detector

## Objectives

1.  Build a class with an initialize method and use an `attr_accessor`

## Description

You will write a program that, given a word and a list of possible
[anagrams][anagrams], selects the correct one(s).

Your class, `Anagram` should take a word on initialization, and instances should
respond to a `match` method that takes an array of possible anagrams. It should
return all matches in an array. If no matches exist, it should return an empty
array.

In other words, given: `"listen"` and `%w(enlists google inlets banana)` the
program should return `["inlets"]`.

```ruby
listen = Anagram.new("listen")
listen.match(%w(enlists google inlets banana))

# => ["inlets"]
```

**Top Tip:** [`%w(some words)`][array_shortcut] is simply a shortcut for
instantiating an array with items in it!

## Instructions

Once again, this lab is test-driven. Run the test suite to get started. Remember
that you can use the `learn/rspec --fail-fast` option to run the tests only up
until the first failure, in order to work progressively through the tests.

Write your solution in `anagram.rb`.

**Hints:**

- Use an `attr_accessor` to create a setter and getter method for the word that
  the Anagram class instances are initialized with.

- How will you determine if one word is an anagram for another?

  - You'll need to iterate over the array of words that the `.match` method
    takes as an argument. You will compare each word of that array to the word
    that the Anagram class is initialized with.

  - To determine if they are anagrams, try determining if they are composed of
    the same letters. Remember that you can split a word into an array of letters
    using `some_word.split("")`. You can compare two arrays using the `==`. For
    example:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 3]
=> true

[1, 3, 2] == [1, 2, 3]
=> false
```

Two arrays are equal if they contain the same elements, in the same order.
Remember that you can `.sort` an arrays elements. This will help in your
comparison:

```ruby
[1, 3, 2].sort == [3, 2, 1].sort
=> true
```
