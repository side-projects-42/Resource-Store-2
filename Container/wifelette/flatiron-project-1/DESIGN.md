### Ideas for Other Commands

```
$ candidate wifelette languages

Of wifelette's 163 public repos, they break down as follows:

* 145 are Ruby (X percent)
* 2 are HTML (X percent)
* 4 are JavaScript (X percent)
* 1 is a Shell (X percent)
```

^ Color the language names? What if I don't know how many or which they'll be? Is there a way to use a `PASTEL.rand` kinda thing?

^ This may not be possible for rate limit reasonsâ€”so far the only way to find this data would be to get ALL the details on ALL their repos and then do a .length for the total number, annnd... so far no way for the type :p GitHub uses Linguist to do it themselves (https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-repository-languages) and so far there's nowhere exposed that they actually _store_ that info.

**Update**: This info lives _inside_ each org's API call, nested inside each repo the user has. So `user > repo > language`, where there are _lots_ of repos potentially belonging to each user. So now I know it's definitely possible and probably not all that complicated, though it would surely be _slow_. For future implementation note:

- https://api.github.com/users/wifelette/repos is the API URL for each user's repo
- Like earlier, this could be popped into a CLI command with `#{username}` interpolated into the URL.
- Once there, another array of hashes.
- Each entry in the array, top level, is a hash of the ID and details of the repo, as a _key_ in another hash. The _value_ attached to the key is yet _more_ data, about the repo _contents_. So it would need to be something like... snag the key-repo-`id`, and then pair it with the nested `language` key/value.
- Lastly, gotta sort out the basic math to tally it all up and spit out the percentages.

This same pattern follows if we went to https://api.github.com/orgs/tildeio/repos to fetch this info on the org level instead of the user level.

### Things to think about later

- **Q**: Is it possible to reorder and/or add categories to how Thor presents all the commands when you type `help`?
- **A**: Looked it up. It's an open feature request, not currently possible.
- **Q**: Some things, like email, won't work unless the person is authed. How to handle?
- **A**: For now I added a specific message for when there's no email. Same for some other fields.
- **Q**: if you accidentally type in just the `candidates user` instead of `candidates user username` a friendly and clear error message would be great
- **A**: Wishlist for later, since it involves default Thor behavior. Right now this isn't something I can touch with my custom errors.

## Custom Error Handling

I started writing a custom error class when I hit a sort-of error in my TTY prompts. However, after a bit I dug into it a bit more, and discovered that TTY themselves had just accepted a PR to fix the issue (not in the way I'd have liked, but fix it just the same). So I abandoned that part, and switched to using the unreleased version of the gem.

Later I added custom errors to handle what happened if you typed in a user that didn't actually exist.
