These are things that one day it would be cool to submit PRs or chat with maintainers about:

- Add link to GitHub to the Thor website
- This fix stops the user from typing in the wrong thing and throwing an exception, and instead now returns "invalid input" but wouldn't it be better if it just plain didn't allow invalid inputs to be typed at all, like elsehwere in `TTY`? https://github.com/piotrmurach/tty-prompt/issues/106
