# Basic Nested Forms Lab

## Objectives

1. Construct a nested params hash with data about the primary object and a belongs to and has many association.
2. Name form inputs correctly to create a nested params hash with belongs to and has many associated data.
3. Define a conventional association writer for the primary model to properly instantiate associations based on the nested params association data.
4. Define a custom association writer for the primary model to properly instantiate associations with custom logic (like unique by name) on the nested params association data.
5. Use fields_for to generate the association fields.

## Data Model: Recipe with ingredients

The first data model we're going to be working with today is a recipe with ingredients.

  * Recipe
    * has many ingredients
    * title:string
  * Ingredient
    * belongs to a recipe
    * ingredient.name: string
    * ingredient.quantity: string

The models and show routes and associations have been set up for you.

### Instructions

Build a recipe form that accepts two ingredients! It should automatically create the new `Ingredient` objects.
