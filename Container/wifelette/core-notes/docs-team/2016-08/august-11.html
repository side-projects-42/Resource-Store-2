<hr />
<h3 id="ember-inspector-video">Ember Inspector video</h3>
<ul>
<li>GJ: video is done (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laxMyrk9P10)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="getting-startedquick-start-video">getting started/quick start video</h3>
<p>DB: would like to have a video like we did in 1.10. Was a nice thing we lost in newer versions</p>
<p>GJ: would be up for it. Will do some research/thought and continue discussion next time</p>
<h3 id="firebase-upgrade">Firebase upgrade</h3>
<p>DB: Email to Leah about upgrading, asking us to use latest infrastructure… Lets try while here.</p>
<p><em>(also gave todd access to firebase)</em></p>
<p>DB: If we can get free SSL that would be great for docs.</p>
<p>LS: Blocked because asking for money… emailing back</p>
<h3 id="search-api">Search API</h3>
<p>TJ: Request brought up by <span class="citation" data-cites="ladyleet">@ladyleet</span>. Could we conceivably proxy the algolia search through our own api service</p>
<p>DB: Yes we could. Would open up things like browser search bar</p>
<p>TJ: will get back and let her know its a possibility</p>
<h3 id="ember-data-guides-pr">Ember data Guides PR</h3>
<p>DB: Reverting back to use old imports. Can we merge.</p>
<p>TJ: Only thing to do would be to include the old imports</p>
<p>DB: Needs to be done quickly because its wrong now</p>
<p>TJ: ok with merging for now <em>(merged)</em></p>
<h3 id="api-docs-effort">API Docs Effort</h3>
<p>TJ: Would like to help when I roll off of tutorial. Should be next week after subroutes is merged</p>
<p>DB: The core piece is making it fastboot because Algolia needs a statically generated page. We are working with heroku</p>
<p>DB: also will have to consider incorporation into the website (engine?) Its becoming a complicated effort.</p>
<p>TJ: want to start rolling things out a little at a time and have a roadmap.</p>
<h3 id="maps-tutorial">Maps tutorial</h3>
<p>DB: couple reports about google maps not working</p>
<p>TJ: Because of 2 things… something about the curl of the google library doesn’t work across machines, so when you download super-rentals, you have to recurl. Could also run out of map requests. It should be fine going through the tutorial from scratch</p>
<p>DB: would be nice to have working when you install super rentals out of the box.</p>
<p>TJ: Will insert a script tag for it on super-rentals and explain in the readme. Will keep the curl command in the tutorial as an intro to the vendor directory.</p>
<h3 id="repo-moves-to-ember-learn">Repo moves to ember-learn</h3>
<p>DB: Permissions (gh-team-copy) tool is ready. Need Blessing/Admin on both sides for this to happen (LS).</p>
<p>LS: ok, will do now <em>(doing)</em> … Found some issues with the tool, feeding back to the repo. Super rentals moved</p>
