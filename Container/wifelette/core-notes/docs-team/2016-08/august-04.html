<h3 id="advanced-docs">Advanced Docs</h3>
<p>RM: was thinking about creating a page and linking Gavin’s deep dive videos.</p>
<p>RM: Hardest part is getting people with in depth source knowledge to pass that info along. Will likely be a slow process.</p>
<p>GJ: what areas should we focus on here</p>
<p>RM: views, run loop, getting extra documentation from netflix, linked in</p>
<p>GJ: talked to rwjblue about deep dive videos in the past. if there were obvious topics I could try setting up with him</p>
<p>TJ: I’ve heard in a couple occasions Ember-cli</p>
<p>RM: Mike North has some thoughts about this and should ping him, as well as netflix and linked in</p>
<h3 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h3>
<p>TJ: 2 items of feedback I’d like on the tutorial subroutes. PR is opened agains super-rentals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the use of “slugs” to just using id routing</li>
<li>used mirage to mock http requests (as opposed to stubbing the store)</li>
</ul>
<p>RM: I’m for just using id routing</p>
<p>TJ: My next part of the tutorial will be creating a reservations form. Will likely put the tutorial down a bit to work on API Doc improvements. Will task what’s next if other want to pick it up.</p>
<h3 id="ember-hearth">Ember Hearth</h3>
<p>RM: munumunum and I are picking it up again. He did a restyling that looks good, still tweaking UI. I’m setting up continuous deployment based on tags. We have osx and linux builds. Trying to get a different packager in ember electron to make it easier to create installers. Also need to understand auto-updates. Will wait for Leah and next meeting to discuss.</p>
<h3 id="translations">Translations</h3>
<p>RM: Couple of problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>People are getting a bit demoralized</li>
<li>We dont have a good workflow to publish updates to guides</li>
</ol>
<p>RM: Want to pull translations out into another repo because:</p>
<ul>
<li>confuses people (some try to update all)</li>
<li>too many files</li>
<li>want to kill the sync bots: too many commits on the source repo
<ul>
<li>want crowdin to trigger sync, not the other way.</li>
<li>need to figure out a better way for versioning</li>
<li>find someone trustworthy to see it through. Some are interested, but not sure of their availability.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="borshomu">BORS/Homu</h3>
<p>RM: Stalled because person working on it set up heroku and bot/webhooks, but the bot wouldn’t recognize the r+ command. Since then that dev has moved on. Need someone to pick up the torch.</p>
<h3 id="gavin">Gavin</h3>
<p>RM: Everyone is on board with Gavin joining. Need to understand process of adding new members. Would love to bring Gavin’s access and video content into our core learning and docs.</p>
<p>GJ: Planned on completing videos for guides next. Hoping to do 1 per week. Would love feedback on that. My focus atm is with Glimmer 2 in Alpha and increasing my Ember role at the company. Post Glimmer 2 my learning capacity should increase as it dovetails with my company’s goal of providing better ember resources to employees.</p>
