## Notes

---

### Ember Inspector video

- GJ: video is done (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laxMyrk9P10)
- GJ:  Needs review before putting it out there
- TJ: Should we get Teddy to look at?

### getting started/quick start video

- GJ: Started looking at this.  Have a basic plan.  Github browser
- GJ: To get design help from Intercom for a nice design
- GJ: Plan to point to a real world usage at the end to show its scaling capability
- GJ: Partially intend it for a pitch for why you should choose Ember.
- DB:  Since this is not a video of the quick start, we should introduce this video separately, like on its own page or the guides landing page.
- GJ: Maybe there's 2 videos to be done (getting started and quick started).  Maybe the one I'm thinking of might be better on the home page, or on the initial guides page, since its partially a sell.
- LS: I have a list I go through with core each week
- DB: Would like to get feedback on the video.
- GJ: can create a basic outline tonight  and stick it in the core team escalation usecanvas
- LS: great just need a link for tomorrow's meeting

### Core Feedback from last week's items

- LS: Permissions tool feedback:  Would like a tool that syncs periodically.
- DB: Security ramifications are concerning to me and the author of the tool
- LS: Welcome page: Did anyone contact you(DB) about welcome page?
- DB: Ed provided some.  Have not yet responded
- LS: Reminding Godfrey
- LS: Should we move the website to learning?   Core was concerned about losing influence.  Assured them that it was not what it was about.  More of a logistical purpose for the team that is implementing the vision. Should we put together a plan for moving?  
- DB: not sure about build.  I think that the other parts would be fine.  Am willing to move when I get time.  Would like to move slowly.

### Firebase

- DB: Did you hear anything from firebase?
- LS:  Looks like she's offering a discount.  Are there free alternatives
- DB: I thought firebase was free so I'm confused.
- LS: Tom was initially involved, so maybe you can get more info out of him
