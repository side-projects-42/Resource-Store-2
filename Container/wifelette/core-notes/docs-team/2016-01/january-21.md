Internationalization

- LS: start with a few languages, Japanese, Portuguese? or something else
  - choose only subset of docs, so can actually ship
- RJ: what url should we use? have concerns about how this will work
- DB: I'll take a look at how CrowdIn syncing might work, based on the issue
- RJ: concerned that need a trusted person to verify translations
- JK: happy to give you a quick demo of how CrowdIn works
  - https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli
  - can use webhooks to deploy (and can setup a translations bot to commit the translations back to the main rep)
  - has ability to handle issues if there are problems with translations
  - support has been quite responsive
- RJ: much happier to see this working in action
- LS: JK, would you be willing to help get infrastructure setup for us?
- JK: yes, I'll start working on getting Ember translations working with CrowdIn
  - just need a crowdin.yaml file (https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/crowdin.yaml)

Workflow for getting core attention on issues
- discussion for a while, note-taker got busy talking :-)

Summary: we'll add a weekly issue to the Github guides repo (tagged with "needs core attention" with a few chosen guides / api docs issues).  But we'll plan to only request attention on 3-5 issues per week
