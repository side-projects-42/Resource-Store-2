<p>DB: Lifecycle hook documentation, I’ll review</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: Autocomplete component, doesn’t strike me as idiomatic Ember yet. Given its prominence early in the tutorial, I’d like eyes on it from core</p>
<p>DB: Agreed</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: Quick start / tutorial / getting started, we need to keep from having three sections here.</p>
<p>DB: Seems like we should keep Getting Started assumptions out of Tutorial</p>
<p>RM: Agreed. I’ll start moving pages around and will merge the Quick Start in under Getting Started</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: Glossary also needs to be merged, but will move that to the bottom of the menu. Wonder about linking mostly to MDN to save on duplicating effort …</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: Tips and tricks, we should get a design for this</p>
<p>DB: Let’s open an issue to act as a placeholder</p>
<hr />
<p>DB: People keep having issues with ember-cli betas and Mirage.</p>
<p>RM: I was working with a guy earlier today, it should all be working</p>
<p>DB: I’ll run through the tutorial again to make sure and will send in a PR about using CLI betas.</p>
