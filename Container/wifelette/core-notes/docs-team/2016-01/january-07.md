DB: Lifecycle hook documentation, I'll review

---

RM: Autocomplete component, doesn't strike me as idiomatic Ember yet. Given its prominence early in the tutorial, I'd like eyes on it from core

DB: Agreed

---

RM: Quick start / tutorial / getting started, we need to keep from having three sections here.

DB: Seems like we should keep Getting Started assumptions out of Tutorial

RM: Agreed. I'll start moving pages around and will merge the Quick Start in under Getting Started

---

RM: Glossary also needs to be merged, but will move that to the bottom of the menu.  Wonder about linking mostly to MDN to save on duplicating effort ...

---

RM: Tips and tricks, we should get a design for this

DB: Let's open an issue to act as a placeholder

---

DB: People keep having issues with ember-cli betas and Mirage.

RM: I was working with a guy earlier today, it should all be working

DB:  I'll run through the tutorial again to make sure and will send in a PR about using CLI betas.
