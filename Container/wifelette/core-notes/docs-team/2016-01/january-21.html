<p>Internationalization</p>
<ul>
<li>LS: start with a few languages, Japanese, Portuguese? or something else
<ul>
<li>choose only subset of docs, so can actually ship</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RJ: what url should we use? have concerns about how this will work</li>
<li>DB: I’ll take a look at how CrowdIn syncing might work, based on the issue</li>
<li>RJ: concerned that need a trusted person to verify translations</li>
<li>JK: happy to give you a quick demo of how CrowdIn works
<ul>
<li>https://github.com/crowdin/crowdin-cli</li>
<li>can use webhooks to deploy (and can setup a translations bot to commit the translations back to the main rep)</li>
<li>has ability to handle issues if there are problems with translations</li>
<li>support has been quite responsive</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RJ: much happier to see this working in action</li>
<li>LS: JK, would you be willing to help get infrastructure setup for us?</li>
<li>JK: yes, I’ll start working on getting Ember translations working with CrowdIn
<ul>
<li>just need a crowdin.yaml file (https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook/blob/master/crowdin.yaml)</li>
</ul></li>

<p>Workflow for getting core attention on issues</p>
<ul>
<li>discussion for a while, note-taker got busy talking :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary: we’ll add a weekly issue to the Github guides repo (tagged with “needs core attention” with a few chosen guides / api docs issues). But we’ll plan to only request attention on 3-5 issues per week</p>
<hr />
<p>Search engine issues with versioned guides</p>
<ul>
<li>discussion of the problem, note-taker got talking :-)</li>
</ul>
<p>Summary: RJ will bring up at core team meeting tomorrow, DB will write up an issue with thoughts (https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/1185)</p>
