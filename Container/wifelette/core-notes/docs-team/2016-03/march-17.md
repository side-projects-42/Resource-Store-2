## Notes

### Algolia Search

DB: Update on Algolia Search? Would like to prototype with guides to try it out with 2.4.

LS: Pulled up email to see who to talk to (Matt).  

RM: Lets do it on staging.   Will let us try it without being open to public.

LS:  Lets keep moving forward.  If it ends up the best thing, LS will contact Matt, explaining the move and thanking them.

### Contextual components

TJ: discussed them with RM.  To create a draft next week as part of block components to get feedback.

-----

### API docs

TJ: things are sorted out, how do I get started on getting the subdomain

LS: probably should talk to Robert

----

### locks

RM: Continuing to work on various projects leading up to emberconf

DB: How can we help?

RM: Creating some issues on the repos

----

### Welcome Page PR

DB: Having trouble getting tests running with it in ember-cli.  Crunched for time so not much progress

LS: Would you need any help? 

DB: Absolutely.  Not tied to it.  

SV:  Will take a look at it to see how far I can get.

----

### Search/SEO

DB: talked to Trek and our options are limited

YK: will talk to google contacts.  May not be the right guys.  schema.org may be the right thing to research next.  other thing to research is to include information in text as a change log.

DB: I can look into schema.org

YK: Will contact Paul Irish, DB ping me on slack
