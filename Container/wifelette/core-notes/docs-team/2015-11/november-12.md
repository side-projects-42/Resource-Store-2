MKN: Thanks David for your work on the Tutorial.

DB: I can finish up the models stuff, but I won't have bandwidth for much else.

RM: I don't have much bandwidth for a while.

MKN: I can take on the rest of cleaning things up and getting it ready for release.

DB: Some people at my meetup last night pointed out a couple problems.

MKN: I will fix them, but it won't be for a couple weeks.

DB: What about the rest of the content for the tutorial that isn't written?

MKN: Nobody has time to write it.

RM: I'll share my notes for the remaining items so that we know what needs to be done after this release.

RM: There is a problem with search, where the version number gets duplicated in the URL.

MKN: I will investigate.
