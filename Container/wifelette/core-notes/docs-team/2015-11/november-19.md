MKN: We shipped 2.2! Yay! But I'm a bit unhappy about a couple things:

1. We had no idea 2.2 was shipping early until the day before.
2. The tutorial didn't get shipped, in part because...
3. We put a bunch of effort into the redesign at the expense of the tutorial.
And the redesign didn't even ship either.

That said, we'll just ship the tutorial and redesign, and re-release.

MKN: Are you going to do some work on https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/977 with Dave?

DB: I'm running out of time these days.

DB: Leah had some concerns about the new design, so it might take some more work to ship it. But I don't see any more comments from her on the PR.

MKN: Can you loop back with her and see if anything is outstanding?

DB: Yup.
