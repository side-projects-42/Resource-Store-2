<p>MKN: Style updates look good!</p>
<p>RM: not much left, mainly cross-browser testing. Let’s merge, deploy to staging, and get people to try it out.</p>
<p>MKN: Let’s throw this at the Slack channels and ask the front-end peeps who have been helping out</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Thanks David for your work on the Tutorial.</p>
<p>DB: I can finish up the models stuff, but I won’t have bandwidth for much else.</p>
<p>RM: I don’t have much bandwidth for a while.</p>
<p>MKN: I can take on the rest of cleaning things up and getting it ready for release.</p>
<p>DB: Some people at my meetup last night pointed out a couple problems.</p>
<p>MKN: I will fix them, but it won’t be for a couple weeks.</p>
<hr />
<p>DB: What about the rest of the content for the tutorial that isn’t written?</p>
<p>MKN: Nobody has time to write it.</p>
<p>RM: I’ll share my notes for the remaining items so that we know what needs to be done after this release.</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: There is a problem with search, where the version number gets duplicated in the URL.</p>
<p>MKN: I will investigate.</p>
