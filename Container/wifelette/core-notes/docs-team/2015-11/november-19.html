<p>MKN: We shipped 2.2! Yay! But I’m a bit unhappy about a couple things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We had no idea 2.2 was shipping early until the day before.</li>
<li>The tutorial didn’t get shipped, in part because…</li>
<li>We put a bunch of effort into the redesign at the expense of the tutorial. And the redesign didn’t even ship either.</li>
</ol>
<p>That said, we’ll just ship the tutorial and redesign, and re-release.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Are you going to do some work on https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/977 with Dave?</p>
<p>DB: I’m running out of time these days.</p>
<p>DB: Leah had some concerns about the new design, so it might take some more work to ship it. But I don’t see any more comments from her on the PR.</p>
<p>MKN: Can you loop back with her and see if anything is outstanding?</p>
<p>DB: Yup.</p>
