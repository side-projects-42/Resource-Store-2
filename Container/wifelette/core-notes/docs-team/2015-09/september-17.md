## Attendees

* MKN - Michael
* LS - Leah
* BM - Brendan McLoughlin


**MKN**: The models section. A lot is stuff I’m not super familiar with, but I took a look, and so did Wecc, and it looks good! It’s been out there for about 4 days and I want to release it.

**BM**: That seems good. I was hoping for feedback from Tom or Igor but we shouldn’t wait on it.

**MKN**: Okay, resolved, we’ll release it and fix and tweak as needed once we start getting feedback. I’m going to re-release 1.13 and 2.0 tonight. When we release 2.1, we can also re-re-release the others. They’re all pretty close to identical except for each-in and git-helpers. So that’s our plan. Thanks so much for your help Brendan!

**MKN**: Trek said he wouldn’t be able to help with the Guides stuff after all, too busy. I won’t be able to help as much as I have been, so I worry about a vacuum in leadership. It would really be great if we found two or three more people to help focus on docs.

**MKN**: There’s still a ton of stuff to do, like improve stateful helpers and clojure actions.

**MKN**: It was really exciting to see Godfrey jump in and write some Glimmer guides. Gave me hope!

**MKN**: The other big looming thing is Routable Components, which I think is going to require a ton of time to go through and remove.

**MKN**: Again, we really need at least a third person. This last week Locks didn’t happen to be around, and there just wasn’t any other person to pick stuff up. All the things Kelly opened for the Getting Started guide are still open. I can help merge those, but I helped her write it, so that doesn’t seem great. We really need to keep an eye out and find one or two more people to help.

**MKN**, **LS**: We renamed the Guides “code” tag to “infrastructure” which communicates what sort of tasks they are a little better.

**MKN**, **LS**: We went through and merged some open Website PRs, got the Docs blog post merged (and BMac deployed) and closed a couple open Website issues too.
