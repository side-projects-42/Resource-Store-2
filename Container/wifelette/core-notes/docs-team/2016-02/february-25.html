<li><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/1241">mixed content issues</a> - assigned to David, I don’t want to worry about backporting this type of fix myself …</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/1208">updating 1.13 docs for Ember-CLI</a> - this seems important to backport</li>

<ul>
<li>continuous deployment setup? - David
<ul>
<li>Would like to see this automatically showing up at /current</li>
<li>seems like this would really help work through SEO stuff as well (easier to test out changes quickly instead of current, somewhat cumbersome deploy process)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>documenting LTS releases as part of guides? - David</li>
<li>Bring back “Understanding Ember” section? quite useful from a “big picture” perspective about how Ember works</li>
