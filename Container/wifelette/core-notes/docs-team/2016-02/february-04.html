<h2 id="minutes">Minutes</h2>
<p>TJ: Maps tutorial: Have an example using g-maps as a service. Would like to merge DB’s PR after deleting the test. We should add a fuller component test example. It would be a good reference. Plan to pr the maps example for feedback on whether its a good use case.</p>
<p>DB: going to open an issue about component integration tests, showing how to pass down actions in them</p>
<hr />
<p>YK: Super-rentals: we need to put a blurb in the top of the readme indicating the current state of super-rentals as to not confuse. Right now its not in a usable state</p>
<p>DB: I’ll add a note to the header of the Readme</p>
<hr />
<p>translations: Leah signed up for an Crowdin account, sent out invites, time is at a premium atm, hoping to work on it more in a bit</p>
<hr />
<p>LS: Codeschool, Ember getting started, have volunteered to have people get going with their tutorial. Leah will talk with Codeschool folks, invite them to the meeting</p>
<hr />
<p>YK: Need to get search working so that it returns current results</p>
<p>DB: been a topic of conversation for a month. Waiting on input from Trek</p>
<p>YK, TD: don’t block on Trek for fixing SEO stuff</p>
<hr />
<p>DB: when Ember-CLI 2.x goes stable, our Ember 1.13 instructions will break for folks</p>
<p>YK, TD: Hmm, not good, let’s go back and fix it to ember-cli@1.13</p>
<hr />
<p>[Ricardo joins us] [Erik joins us]</p>
<p>(some discussion lost here)</p>
<p>discussion of issue on Ember website, topics to discuss on the website (https://github.com/emberjs/website/issues/2460)</p>
<p>TD: We should aim to keep guides geared toward people new to this field</p>
<p>EB: issue came out of looking through a client’s chat room and seeing a lot of confusion and misinformation about how ember works and why.</p>
<p>RM: This information really frequently gets behind because only a few core contributers are really qualified to explain</p>
<p>DB: If we do have docs on advanced topics, would need core team members writing them.</p>
<p>EB: Documenting these things could force the core team to get the same page on them. Could try to lead that effort in getting input from the core team.</p>
<p>TD: Conclusion: need to work on a feature dashboard. Understanding ember section is valuable - is more stable now then it used to be. Need a core team member to put the information together and a doc team member to massage the information.</p>
<hr />
<p>TJ: What are the plans around incorporating ember-cli docs into emberjs?</p>
<p>RM: The thought is we keep ember-cli as primarily geared to addon developers. When 2.x lands we’ll consider adding content around using ember-cli to create projects.</p>
<p>TD: Proposes combining ember-cli/emberjs docs because they are so cross-cutting</p>
<p>RM: We need better structure to the guides before incorporating ember-cli</p>
<p>TD: Newbies tend to be more task oriented</p>
<p>RM: Front page, community and guides section need structural work</p>
