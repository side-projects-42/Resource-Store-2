<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>Codeschool tutorial: looking forward to seeing how things go, may end up having videos aimed at LTS releases. Started reviewing the CodeSchool materials and so far so good. Short conversation about the specifics of the material and having it <em>plus</em> having our own in-house super-rentals tutorial (text / git repo)</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-experience">Getting Started Experience</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ember-CLI landing page could use some love. Leah remembered <a href="https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues/4977">posting a Tomster in response to an Issue about</a> this but nothing happened with it.</li>
<li>Speak to next steps on the Welcome page after starting the project for the first time, including…
<ul>
<li>Watchman (Leah mentioned the warning threw her as a newbie. ways to improve these to be friendlier?)</li>
<li>Phantomjs (apparently hit errors with this when start testing if don’t have it installed per Todd)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>David to work on a PR that provides this. Instead of hardcoding a bunch of CSS and markup in the application template, discussed alternatives such as including a script tag(Matt) or component (todd)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="site-redesign-discussion">Site Redesign Discussion</h3>
<p>Leah: The current redesigns have stalled again. I’m in minority, but actually not bothered by current design of the site. happy to have the current site reworked design-wise by people (either new design or using the guides CSS) if someone wants to put in the time/effort.</p>
<p>Matt: Would be nice to see it responsive</p>
<p>Todd: Would be nice to see just the same theme from the guides propagated to the rest</p>
<p>Matt: (intern) Is going to add a page for the survey that will be responsive. Will update the heading style universally as part of that work.</p>
<hr />
<p>starting brainstorming on resources (put in a canvas file, share them and we’ll update the Community page in a bit)</p>
