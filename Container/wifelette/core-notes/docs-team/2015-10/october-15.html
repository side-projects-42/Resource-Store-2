<p>MKN: Guides index PR looks nice.</p>
<p>RM: Will work on your comments.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Preferences on linking to API methods - we need a decision. (https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/876)</p>
<p>RM: No strong position. I like the Ruby notation: Object#method. But this is not as usual in JS.</p>
<p>MKN: Let’s just merge the PR and open an issue to do this througout the Guides.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Issue with get and mut helpers - what to do. (https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/861)</p>
<p>RJ: Standalone guide on get helper is not justified. Maybe just add a reference to the API docs which have a nice example of using it with the {{input}} helper.</p>
<p>MKN: I will do this.</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: What to do about hosting?</p>
<p>RJ: Our needs are very simple.</p>
<p>MKN: Let’s just try Firebase hosting.</p>
<p>RJ: Yes, this seems the most straightforward. Trek and I migrated a couple projects from Divshot and it was trivial.</p>
<p>MKN: Let’s deploy 2.2 to Divshot and Firebase and then we can just flip the switch and try it out.</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: API docs are moving to an Ember app. Maybe Heroku can sponsor us?</p>
<p>RJ: Maybe. Also Tom Dale has been working on getting FastBoot running on AWS Lambda.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Is the only outstanding redeployment issue the version warning?</p>
<p>RJ: Too difficult to backport it. Solution is to have a single asset that all versions load - we can update that asset.</p>
<p>The asset should be in the https://github.com/emberjs/guides.emberjs.com repo. Just need to add it there and then just cherry-pick a commit into older versions. Then we can add version-detection to that file, and it will be added to older versions automagically.</p>
<hr />
<p>RJ: When do we merge in docs on new features?</p>
<p>RM: We have tags for versions. After review 2 weeks before release is cut, then we merge any docs on new features for that version.</p>
<p>RJ: Great. This will also let us re-release whenever there are fixes. But we run the risk of rebase hell. Maybe we can just merge to a feature branch so that progress can continue there.</p>
<p>MKN: You can do the same thing by just pulling down the code locally by adding their repo as a remote.</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: I recently deployed master to divshot as “edge”.</p>
<p>RJ: We could even automate that as part of the Travis build.</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: Versioned API docs Ember app.</p>
<p>RJ: Anything that works is better than today. Could even be beta-api.emerjs.com if it’s ugly.</p>
<p>RM: I will get the app upgraded to the latest Ember and deal with remaining issues. It’s deployed to Divshot now. Then we can pair to finish it off.</p>
<hr />
<p>RM: Igor and Bmac are working on new stuff for the model section.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Let’s go over the tutorial to-dos.</p>
<p>RJ: What to use for backend? Very valuable to have it hooked up to a backend with real XHR requests, like the real world.</p>
<p>RM: Let’s have the tutorial test-driven and use Mirage. (Mirage is moving to JSON API.) Then at the end have something about connecting to a backend. Either have a demo application they can clone, or a host set up.</p>
<p>MKN: I really like this.</p>
<p>RJ: I’ll do a review of the tutorial now and also run the general structure by the core team.</p>
<p>MKN: Let’s come up with some deadlines. By October 22, rewrite existing stuff TDD’d and have signoff or actionable feedback from Core.</p>
<p>RM: Everything else depends on this, so let’s figure out the rest of the deadlines next week.</p>
