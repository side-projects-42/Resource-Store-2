<hr />
<p>TD: We should get the new design in.</p>
<p>MKN: No bandwidth from me, or locks it seems.</p>
<p>TD: It shouldn’t be hard to do. I’ll ping locks and see if it’s okay if I find somebody else.</p>
<hr />
<p>TD: I liked the glossary. I thought that was helpful.</p>
<p>YK: I really liked the glossary too.</p>
<p>MKN: I hated the glossary. It felt like a junk drawer of random terms without good definitions or links.</p>
<p>TD: It’s a good list of terms that are not Ember-specific that Ember developers will encounter.</p>
<p>MKN: I agree to disagree.</p>
<p>TD: We should have guidelines about what goes in the glossary.</p>
<p>YK: Just put it at the top of the glossary page.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Should we include “assumptions” on the homepage, as locks proposed?</p>
<p>TD and YK: It’s a good idea.</p>
<p>MKN: What about updating jsmodules.io? I opened a PR: https://github.com/wycats/jsmodules/pull/13.</p>
<p>YK: We’re trying to sell to Node people and also not be completely contrived. Your PR looks ok though.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: What is the next step for standardizing inflection defining? https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/899</p>
<p>TD: 1. File an issue on ember cli. 2. In the interim, just say to write this code.</p>
<p>MKN: I will move this forward.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: Anybody want to review classical component lifecycle? https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/902/files</p>
<p>TD: I would like to review it more closely.</p>
<p>YK: We can also document new lifecycle hooks, but only without arguments.</p>
<hr />
<p>MKN: You can’t <code>npm install phantomjs2</code> on Linux. There is an issue and PR to note this.</p>
<p>YK: We should ping somebody to address this.</p>
