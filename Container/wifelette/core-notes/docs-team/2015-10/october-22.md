TD: We should get the new design in.

MKN: No bandwidth from me, or locks it seems.

TD: It shouldn't be hard to do. I'll ping locks and see if it's okay if I find somebody else.

-----

TD: I liked the glossary. I thought that was helpful.

YK: I really liked the glossary too.

MKN: I hated the glossary. It felt like a junk drawer of random terms without good definitions or links.

TD: It's a good list of terms that are not Ember-specific that Ember developers will encounter.

MKN: I agree to disagree.

TD: We should have guidelines about what goes in the glossary.

YK: Just put it at the top of the glossary page.

-----

MKN: Should we include "assumptions" on the homepage, as locks proposed?

TD and YK: It's a good idea.

MKN: What about updating jsmodules.io? I opened a PR: https://github.com/wycats/jsmodules/pull/13.

YK: We're trying to sell to Node people and also not be completely contrived. Your PR looks ok though.

-----

MKN: What is the next step for standardizing inflection defining? https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/899

TD: 1. File an issue on ember cli. 2. In the interim, just say to write this code.

MKN: I will move this forward.

-----

MKN: Anybody want to review classical component lifecycle? https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/902/files

TD: I would like to review it more closely.

YK: We can also document new lifecycle hooks, but only without arguments.

-----

MKN: You can't `npm install phantomjs2` on Linux. There is an issue and PR to note this.

YK: We should ping somebody to address this.
