## Topic

* Tutorial

* Guides index page
* Homepage
* Prose style

**MK**: 1.13 rebasing / backporting

**LK**: super hard, SaladFork said they're interested in helping

**MK**: cherrypick version switcher

**LK**: confirm

**MK**: what's the status on the tutorial

**LK**: with the 2.1 release I haven't had a chance to dive into it

* **MK** checks tutorial *

**MK**: I don't think kelly is going to have time again to contribute to this

**MK**: I suggest we move on and make PRs against that branch without involver her

**MK**: we need to write new content for 2.2

**LK**: I'm going to fill out the Guides' index with a bit more information

**LK**: I want to make it a bit more welcoming and also add assumptions like the [Ruby on Rails Guides][RoRG]

**MK**: Kelly explains and links to when introducing a new technology/concept

**LK**: another thing I want to do is make the Guides in general less terse

**LK**: I worry that newcomers might be put off in some sections

**MK**: I am ok with this, but I personally don't have interesting in doing this

**LK**: just want to make sure we're on the same page

**LK**: I also think that the homepage could be improved with a more heavy focus on community

**LK**: it should also link more explicitely to a getting started tutorial

**TD**: I would have to have a better call to action but it's gated on the tutorial and the guides

**TD**: so I suggest landing the new design and the tutorial first

**LK**: how will we handle the fact that the older versions of the guides won't have the new design?

**TD**: I am ok with that

**BM**: I will have some free time next week to help with Ember Data

**BM**: if there's some Guides stuff I can help with let me know

**BM**: I was going to write about errors

**LK**: thumbs up, that's something we need

**LS**: I want to bring to attention again that we still need deprecation guides written for 1.x

**MK**: did you ping the Slack channels?

**LS**: yes, can one of you do it this time?

* **MK** goes robot *

**LK**: **TD** has the most reach, can you do it?

**TD**: I will tweet about it and post to Slack

* **LS** goes full robot *

**TD**: you never go full robot

* smalltalk *

* **MK** closes out the meeting *
