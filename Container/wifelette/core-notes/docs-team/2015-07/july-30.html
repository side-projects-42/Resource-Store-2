<p>These minutes are worse than <span class="citation" data-cites="locks">@locks</span>â€™s. Sorry. God willing he will be back next week.</p>
<ul>
<li>stefanpenner said he has had several companies make the same ember data mistakes and wants to help with the guides</li>
<li>wecc and tomdale are very excited to help with models/ember data too</li>
<li>michaelrkn said to loop in with locks on that</li>
<li>https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/408 - michael will close this and open specific issues</li>
<li>mixonic will take on updating the guides with closure actions</li>
<li>how to get content back ported into 1.13 - moratorium or cherry-picking?</li>
<li>michaelrkn says cherry-picking, says that locks says moratorium</li>
<li>2.0 and 1.13 will be mostly be the same</li>
<li>trek points out actually they will diverge</li>
<li>after some discussion, cherry-picking is chosen</li>
</ul>
