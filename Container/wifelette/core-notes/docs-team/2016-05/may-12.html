<li>When to use <code>let</code> vs <code>const</code> in examples
<ul>
<li>For reference https://github.com/emberjs/guides/pull/1399/files</li>

<li>TJ: Will follow up</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="twiddle">Twiddle</h3>
<ul>
<li>DB: AWS domain and infra.: Can it move to ember? Would like to be “blessed” as an official ember project.</li>
<li>LS: reached out to joostdevries (pinged on the call)</li>
<li>LS: Tomsters: Lots of projects are on hold (ember data, liquid fire, ember-cli)</li>
<li>DB: could be a sub-project under cli.</li>
<li>LS: We should chat with Yehuda, and then Steph</li>
<li>DB: Will have that discussion with Yehuda, how to proceed if its an idea to go forward with.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>LS: have we been working on getting Roberts brain contents documented?</li>
<li>RM: not been able to</li>
<li>LS: he has been having regular meetings with Yehuda and Godfrey. Would be good to see if there is anything coming out of that that should go into docs</li>
<li>RM: will do</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="current-projects">Current Projects</h3>
<ul>
<li>DB: Any word from Stanley?</li>
<li>RM: Pinged him on Slack, been elusive</li>
<li>DB: What are our most important efforts right now?</li>
<li>RM: want to get the website CI done and would like help - will open up other improvements once deploy</li>
<li>RM: CTA merged!</li>
<li>RM: Search, CI, Tutorial, Translations (tied into the new guides viewer)</li>
<li>DB: Looked at guides viewer this morning. Robust addon from ed faulkner. Loads guide from current site and handles parsing.</li>
<li>RM: the guides stuff is more important than getting the permission bot going</li>
<li>DB: help wanted is working except firebase is a poor place to have the data</li>
<li>RM: Why not couchdb, where I have the wip guides, stanley’s api stuff</li>
<li>DB: will it handle the traffic? emberjs gets tons of monthly views, we need to consider that kind of scale for new things we deploy. Will look into it.</li>
<li>RM: Builds Page: mununum? was willing to help, can outsource.</li>
<li>DB: last night at denver contribution meetup, someone put in a responsive PR. If we can encourage him, he can do more CSS for us on the website.</li>
<li>RM: would be good to have screenshots on the PR.</li>
<li>DB: He is willing and eager to help. Does lots of CSS in his job.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="website-redesign">Website Redesign</h3>
<ul>
<li>RM: Acorns posted a redesign on dribble</li>
<li>RM: found a Designer Developer that wants to take things forward</li>
<li>RM: Not crazy about the design overall (too much) need to reconcile what is good from the design with what we want him to take forward.</li>
<li>DB: Could we focus him on the Learn Page?</li>
<li>RM: there was a big PR for the website that just dropped off the map.</li>
<li>DB: Have talked to him in past, will follow up.</li>
