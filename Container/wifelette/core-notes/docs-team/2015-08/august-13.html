<h4 id="minutes">Minutes</h4>
<p>Attendees: Trek (TG), Leah (LS), locks (LK), Michael (MK) (via locks), Tom (TD), Yehuda (YK), Brendan (BM), Christoffer (CP), Matthew (MB)</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: I (LK) arrived late so these are not full minutes</p>
<p>LS: mixonic Core.View deprecation</p>
<p>YK: no performance advantage to Core.View</p>
<p>you should use a component instead</p>
<p>YK: confirm</p>
<p>YK: Core.View should not be in wide use</p>
<p>MB+YK: <deprecations guides talk></p>
<p>YK: deprecations guide link should use id</p>
<p>this should be tested automatically</p>
<p>LK: how do you redirect old anchors?</p>
<p>MB: using a hidden anchor. pattern already used in website</p>
<p>LK: <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/guides/issues/585">Issue #585</a> brings up some good points</p>
<p>content would need editing to be merged back into guides, but we should take ideas from it</p>
<p>current “Core Concepts” is mostly a glossary</p>
<p>TD: I like the idea of adding diagrams</p>
<p>MB: current styling makes it hard to read text</p>
<p>TG: Ember’s steep learning curve is due to unfamiliarity with client-side app development</p>
<p><gives Unity example for game development></p>
<p>MB: I can fold this into my efforts</p>
<p>LK: I’m assigning it to you MB</p>
<p>LK: you haven’t reviewed <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/api/pull/30">PR #30</a> yet TG</p>
<p>TG: ping me, I’ll review it later today</p>
<p>MK: really awesome how more people are jumping into helping out eg HeroicEric, acorncom, SaladFork, elbeezy, joost, eccegordo, mattw59 let’s continue to engage them and see if any of them will pick up some of the below items</p>
<p>MK: models section - we need somebody to own this, and we need a due date</p>
<p>LK: I’m stepping as the leader for the Models section</p>
<p>I’ll coordinate with Stefan, BM, CP to pick it up</p>
<p>MK: tutorial - radio silence from lauren, i am too busy. we need an owner and a due date. i can catch them up and me and lauren’s discussion/work so far.</p>
<p>LK: I’ll lead this instead, I should be more comfortable with writing for this</p>
<p>YK: I would like that</p>
<p>MK: style guide - i will open a pr with a draft by next tuesday</p>
<p>YK: do you mean a user style guide or a contributor style guide?</p>
<p>LK: contributor</p>
<p>YK: I was thinking about user style guide</p>
<p>TD: we can enable it by default in ember-cli</p>
<p>MK: full guides review - we should review each section from top to bottom for accuracy, clarity, brevity, and completeness. i propose we find an owner for each section (templates, routing, models, etc) and set a due date. i have started on routing.</p>
<p>TD: we should do a group read-through</p>
<p>LK: agreed</p>
<p>TG: we should have an edit, preferably someone for core</p>
<p>I volunteer myself and MB</p>
<p>the editor should review 2 weeks before each release</p>
<p>this also sets a deadline for documentation contributions</p>
<p><chatter about coordinating the redesign of the guides></p>
