<hr />
<h2 id="algolia">Algolia</h2>
<ul>
<li>DB: can we get a confirmation on how we want to handle this?</li>
<li>TD: I’m fine with going with Algolia</li>
<li>DB: cool, I’ll get started on this then</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>
<ul>
<li>LS: YK is not getting love from the google team. Exploring other avenues</li>
<li>DB: Canonical URL is a way, but it wipes out old versions from google’s index, but YK was wondering if a schema would work, that’s why he was seeking advice. Canonical is better than we have now.</li>
<li>TD: we have algolia, and if we are good about semver, things should stay somewhat compatible. We’ve spent a lot of time on this and am not confident google will have anything useful for us, so lets go canonical. Do it after our switch to algolia.</li>
<li>DB: since I’m touching all that anyway, I might as well do them both at the same time.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="responsivenesswebsite">Responsiveness/Website</h3>

<li>RM: Found out how to do continuous deployment, need to figure out the permissions so that right user (bot) can kick it off (commit). Also working out the new learning page.</li>

<li>RM: working on this week in Ember newsletter will send LS a draft</li>
