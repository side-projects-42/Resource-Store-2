# Agenda

### Are we comfortable with
[https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/4356](https://github.com/emberjs/data/pull/4356)
being a bugfix?

pangratz: I thought we thought of this as a bug fix discussed in [a previous
meeting](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes/blob/master/ember-data/2016-04/april-20.md#the--reload-backgroundreload--situation)

- Resolution: Bring in behind feature flag, "go" it for next beta cycle
