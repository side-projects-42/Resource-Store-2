## Discussion Notes

### ember.js build

- Weird issues still outstanding.
- Fred problem has gone away.
- `git clean -fdx` should probably be documented to make sure we're using most up-to-date deps.

### Run top N Addons in Ember Observer
- Works-ish, but addons doing things like using firefox as a test target breaks it.

### Bring ember-addon-secrets blog post into docs

- [http://emberup.co/ember-addon-secrets/](http://emberup.co/ember-addon-secrets/)
- Jake reached out to author Brian Sipple to see if he was interested in letting us add some of the info from his blog post into our docs, was open to the idea.
- Offered to create outline highlighting the points to extract for docs.
