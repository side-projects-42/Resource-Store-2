## Discussion Notes

### Working Model
* The working model of this group is primarily going to be to assign champions for particular tasks.
* It isn't particularly the intent of this group to discuss the technical components in great detail in this meeting.
* The idea is to ensure that there is communication as to what we're all working on.
* Think of it as a standup: "Here is what I've done, here is what I'm doing, here are things we should talk about."
* Identify topics that we want to discuss, aggressively prioritize them.

### Meeting Format
* Brief check in from each attendee.
* Discuss tasks where coordinated effort is required.
* Community contribution survey, identify specific people to invite for future conversations based upon their work.
* Hard stop at 30 minutes.

### Prioritization of Tasks
* First priority are always scratching your own itches. External motivation gets us a lot further.
* Second priority tasks are things which make the ergonomics for contributing to the project easier. (The reality is that having a "core team" doesn't scale as well as we'd like as the project gets larger and more complicated.)
* Third priority items don't exist, it's just some long backlog of ideas.

### First Pass at Tasks and Champions
* Chad Hietala - No time. Consulting available for linker/packager.
* Erik Trom - IPv4/IPv6 issues.
