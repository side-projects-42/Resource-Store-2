<h3 id="working-model">Working Model</h3>
<ul>
<li>The working model of this group is primarily going to be to assign champions for particular tasks.</li>
<li>It isn’t particularly the intent of this group to discuss the technical components in great detail in this meeting.</li>
<li>The idea is to ensure that there is communication as to what we’re all working on.</li>
<li>Think of it as a standup: “Here is what I’ve done, here is what I’m doing, here are things we should talk about.”</li>
<li>Identify topics that we want to discuss, aggressively prioritize them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meeting-format">Meeting Format</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brief check in from each attendee.</li>
<li>Discuss tasks where coordinated effort is required.</li>
<li>Community contribution survey, identify specific people to invite for future conversations based upon their work.</li>
<li>Hard stop at 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="prioritization-of-tasks">Prioritization of Tasks</h3>
<ul>
<li>First priority are always scratching your own itches. External motivation gets us a lot further.</li>
<li>Second priority tasks are things which make the ergonomics for contributing to the project easier. (The reality is that having a “core team” doesn’t scale as well as we’d like as the project gets larger and more complicated.)</li>
<li>Third priority items don’t exist, it’s just some long backlog of ideas.</li>
</ul>
