<h2 id="discussion-notes">Discussion Notes</h2>
<h3 id="rfc-4---processes">RFC #4 - Processes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our current story for process management is nonexistent</li>
<li>Our process for additional server tools is leveraging side effects of the original implementation.
<ul>
<li>The API wasn’t necessarily designed, and was instead just present.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We want to design a lifecycle for tying child processes to ember-cli and provide bidirectional communication between these processes.</li>
<li>Concerns:
<ul>
<li>sigterm cleanup</li>
<li>Play nicely with Windows</li>
</ul></li>
<li>This will allow us to clean up the overloaded middleware story:
<ul>
<li>Express server: http mock, http proxy, livereload, ember-cli-csp</li>
<li>It would allow us to possibly pull the server out of ember-cli and into an addon.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rfc-35---platforms">RFC #35 - Platforms</h3>
<ul>
<li>Desire is to add a new flag and tweak the semantics of some of the core ember-cli commands.</li>
<li>The approach is clear, but falls down a slippery slope. How do we decide which features make it into ember-cli</li>
<li>Further, the more complex commands need rather serious surgery in order to do the right thing: serve &amp; test are watch commands and communicate to external processes.</li>
<li>Ideally the feature spec’d within would be an addon, we should rewrite this to figure out the core features required in order to implement it as an addon.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="core-extensibility-primitive">Core Extensibility Primitive</h3>
<ul>
<li>We should be thinking about how to extend the core ember-cli primitive of a command via an addon, possibly each one of those has its own lifecycle.</li>
<li>Not only that, but these addons need to customize things like Testem, and more, so it makes sense to have a process manager that can be hooked into.</li>
<li>Apparently there is a pipeline primitive in ember-cli-deploy which we might want to explore.</li>
<li>The basic primitive should have the ability to be isolated to allow for multiple simultaneous invocations.</li>
<li>Possible use case of “in-repo platform” as something possibly easier to do with a broccoli-funnel instead of overriding the resolver uniquely per platform.</li>
<li>Command line options would need to be propogated into each addon as we won’t know what is and isn’t legal at top level anymore.</li>
<li>(V2) Should support multiple simultaneous outputs from a single input, even watched states like servers and testing. A primitive version can be done by forking a broccoli tree.</li>
</ul>
