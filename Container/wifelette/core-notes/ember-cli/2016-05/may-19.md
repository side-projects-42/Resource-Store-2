### 2.6 - core-object

- Stef will try to get the fix in before the weekend
- If not, Nathan will help revert (worst case).

### Test Suite

- Need owner.
- Slow test reform.
- Stef to provide an example, with some scenarios and try to make it easy for others to help.

### Modules (Jake)

- What are the things that need to be done? (We need information from Rob.)
- ember-core must land first (for blueprints to work nicely)
- Pod code removal.
- Will result in the removal of folder structure layout on the ember-cli site, as the ember guides will support.

### Deprecations

- Need a deprecation guide for Ember CLI like Ember has.
- Each assigned a version. Reach out to learning and see if we can use Ember's.
