-   \[x\] Caching
-   \[x\] Redirection - handling `intermediateTransitionTo`, deleting `html` on 3xx responses

Notes
-----

-   Shoebox
    -   Takes state from the server side and stores it in the DOM via `<script>` tags that is available to the browser side via `fastboot` service
    -   Released in 1.0.0-beta.2
    -   Docs in ember-cli-fastboot repo
    -   Could be used to store models from routes (if you can serialize the object)
    -   Ember data a target to take advantage of shoebox now
    -   RJ: Consideration: Should controller state end up in the shoebox
        -   TD: We utilize Query Params to maintain controller state
-   Fastboot-app-server
    -   gained support for caching via redis
    -   does not cache status code or headers
    -   Massive performance increase (300-1000ms down to 30ms)
    -   inbound request available to bust cache in needed
-   Fastboot, fastboot-app-server, ember-cli-fastboot in 1.0 beta
    -   ember-fastboot-server deprecated
    -   heroku buildpack was accidentally broken, TD has been working on fix
-   Redirection
    -   `replaceWith/transitionTo` work
    -   `intermediateTransitionTo` :boom:, does not render the new page content (keeping the old content before `intermediateTransitionTo`) aka not actually transitioning
    -   RJ: Likely an Ember bug (based on AS’s PR)
    -   AS: thinks it has to do with how router handles intermediate transitions
        -   RJ: will try to take time to reproduce in browser land this weekend
        -   AS: to double check for steps to reproduce
    -   Current response renders the body
        -   Potential for data leakage
    -   Aborting rendering: Yay/Nay - Nay
        -   Would cause multiple redirection responses if you had multiple `transitionTo`
        -   Better experience to follow the thread of redirects (less requests)
        -   When chaining down redirects, if you lose state, you could not hit the same routes based on new requests
    -   `NoneLocation` should not be hardcoded (separate, future PR)
-   Ember-cli-head and Ember-cli - RJ has to write up the path forward

Action Items
------------

-   \[ \] AS/RJ will investigate issues around `intermediateTransitionTo` to determine if it is a Ember or FastBoot issue
-   \[ \] RJ to write up proposal of path foward for ember-cli and ember-cli-head integration
