## Agenda

- [ ] Last Week's Action Items

  - [x] AS/RJ will investigate issues around `intermediateTransitionTo` to determine if it is a Ember or FastBoot issue
  - [ ] RJ to write up proposal of path forward for ember-cli and ember-cli-head integration

- [x] Wrongly-serialized attributes
- [x] Gzip/deflate support in najax
- [x] ember fastboot --watch
- [x] npm requires do not have prototype extensions (e.g. Array.prototype.sortBy)

## Notes

- intermediateTransitionTo

  - AS created an app that had the issue, ping @rwjblue with it, hasn't heard back from @rwjblue - AS: Traced to tildeio/router issue - Semi-related: router.js may be moving to TypeScript, many errors in router.js seem to be type errors

  - Next Steps: - Tildeio/router issue: is this generally broken (waiting for Rob to confirm)

- PSA: Action on dom element: Renders the function.toString into the html (` `) - Fixed on Canary Ember, update to Canary if you see this issue
       - Gzip/deflate support in najax
               - najax does not support gzip/deflate (blows up Ember-Data when response is compressed)
               - AS: [PR outstanding on najax](https://github.com/najaxjs/najax/pull/38)

       - ember fastboot --watch
               - Needs team review: https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot/pull/200
               - Agreement on `ember fastboot` should watch by default

      - Ember-cli-fastboot should eventually hook into `ember serve`
      - Ember 2.6 just dropped, which means ember fastboot 1.0 has 6 weeks left before release
      - FastBoot got press at Google IO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srdKq0DckXQ
      - Ember Prototype extensions weren't available in an array created by an najax response
               - npm packages that are required are from the root node VM, which creates new realms and prevents requirements from being extended by Ember
               - Potential fix: create your own require that is with a known realm
               - This will bite people in the future (who are using prototype extensions)
               - Looks like a heisenbug: Extensions will only be available some of the time, depending on the origination of the object/array
