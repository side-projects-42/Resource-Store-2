<li><p>intermediateTransitionTo</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AS created an app that had the issue, ping <span class="citation" data-cites="rwjblue">@rwjblue</span> with it, hasn’t heard back from <span class="citation" data-cites="rwjblue">@rwjblue</span> - AS: Traced to tildeio/router issue - Semi-related: router.js may be moving to TypeScript, many errors in router.js seem to be type errors</p></li>
<li><p>Next Steps: - Tildeio/router issue: is this generally broken (waiting for Rob to confirm)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>PSA: Action on dom element: Renders the function.toString into the html (<code></code>) - Fixed on Canary Ember, update to Canary if you see this issue - Gzip/deflate support in najax - najax does not support gzip/deflate (blows up Ember-Data when response is compressed) - AS: <a href="https://github.com/najaxjs/najax/pull/38">PR outstanding on najax</a></p>
<pre><code> - ember fastboot --watch
         - Needs team review: https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot/pull/200
         - Agreement on `ember fastboot` should watch by default

- Ember-cli-fastboot should eventually hook into `ember serve`
- Ember 2.6 just dropped, which means ember fastboot 1.0 has 6 weeks left before release
- FastBoot got press at Google IO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srdKq0DckXQ
- Ember Prototype extensions weren&#39;t available in an array created by an najax response
         - npm packages that are required are from the root node VM, which creates new realms and prevents requirements from being extended by Ember
         - Potential fix: create your own require that is with a known realm
         - This will bite people in the future (who are using prototype extensions)
         - Looks like a heisenbug: Extensions will only be available some of the time, depending on the origination of the object/array</code></pre></li>
