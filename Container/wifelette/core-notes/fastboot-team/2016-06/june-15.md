## Notes

- Discussion of whether `afterRender` should be invoked in FastBoot
- Anything that touches the DOM in `afterRender` should only be
  scheduled from inside a DOM-only hook (like `didInsertElement`)
- [Watcher PR](https://github.com/ember-fastboot/ember-cli-fastboot/pull/200)
  - DM: There's been some review of the Watcher PR. Rob had made some
    comments on it. Most of the comments are around using the existing
    server `reload` mechanism. We also noticed that every time you reload
    the app, it does an `npm install`. If you're going to be modifying your
    `package.json` we should probably have people manually restart.
    - RJ: In Ember CLI in general, `package.json` changes require a
      server restart anyway.
    - PF: That was an intentional decision to make sure
      `FastBoot.require()`d dependencies were available.
    - TD: Broccoli is perfect for caching node_modules when the
      package.json changes, we could build a broccoli task to handle the
      npm install, rather than explicitly calling npm install
    - EF: Browserify could be a viable alternative rather than our
      somewhat hacky solution of calling npm install. Need to build a
      stable plug (rather than calling npm install on build OR deployment).
      npm could change between building and deploying, killing your app in
      prod
    - RJ: We expect dist/fastboot/node_modules to be present, this will
      be killed by broccoli rebuild.
    - PF: Can we treat these optimizations as a separate task?
    - Let's bring in Ember-suave
    - Land this as is, then suave-ize ember-cli-fastboot
- 1.0 readiness
  - No tasks are blockers for 1.0
  - testing for addons
    - First pass: Does the app boot with the addon
    - ember-try is more configurable to allow customized
      testing
    - TD: Hold off until the grand test unification RFC lands
      - RJ: willing to add FastBoot related primatives
    - TD: Do we want to us another driver to test fastboot or
      do we want to implement our own subset of a browser so
      that we can run some tests against the response
    - EF: extract the URLs that are hit in your existing tests
      then make sure those don't blow up against FastBoot
    - TD: At the end of the day: people can run selenium tests
      if they need them
  - performance regressions
    - AS: feels like 2x the regular build time (which would
      likely be a minimum increase)
    - RJ: We should be able to reduce the number of things we
      are doing twice
    - TD: Tree shaking is a good time to address this
    - Separate vendor files for Browser vs Node
      - `app.import` could be fastboot aware
      - TD: wants to write an RFC to introduce build
        targets in ember-cli
- `concatFiles` has been deprecated
  - ember-cli will remove this in the future
  - RJ: we use it for stripping out initializers
- Documentation
  - Policy RE public vs private
  - Inline code doc: YUIDoc and doc blocking
- We should triage our issues
  - RJ: We should be better at labelling issues
