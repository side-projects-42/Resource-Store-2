<p><strong>Survey</strong></p>
<p>MB and YK chatted about the community survey, and about the importance of prioritizing questions about what version of Ember people are on.</p>
<p><strong>LTS</strong></p>
<p>YK: I want people to realize that LTS people don’t want to stable release right away.</p>
<p>RJ: I want the cavets about dates for releases to be v. specific.</p>
<p>RJ: We should post by Monday to allow a gap before the 2.4 releases.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Train</strong></p>
<p>YK: this is the last chance for going feature in 2.5.</p>
<p>RJ: I’d like to go the ember assign feature. <code>ember-metal-ember-assign</code></p>
<p>YK: Yeah, small and seems good.</p>
<p>RJ: There is another FF that was set to “true”, and tests were failing without it. This means we should set that to <code>null</code> and fix the behavior. In the future we should ensure all PRs are merge with the FF as <code>null</code> so there is a clean build with it disabled.</p>
<p>YK: This is <code>ember-test-helpers-fire-native-events</code>, lets go</p>
<p>RJ: And we should go <code>ember-htmlbars-local-lookup</code>, though that is just an API change for the eventual 3rd party stuff</p>
<p>YK: FWIW I like rust’s stabilize terminology, better than “go”</p>
<p>RJ: FWIW the native events things should be a bugfix, but we want to be able to back out of it easily. Not really a new feature.</p>
<p>YK: It is intended to be 100% backwards compatible.</p>
<p>YK: Might be nice to use the feature flagging infrastructure for non-FF things in the future</p>
<p>KS: Like deprecations for svelte builds</p>
<p>YK: Right that is another case. we should be able to use the tooling without using feature flags.</p>
<p>RJ: It’s all generic enough to use with new method names beside isEnabled etc. Should be possible.</p>
<p><strong>ember npm package</strong></p>
<p>YK: We should think about what it takes to use the ember package as the entry package for ember-cli</p>
<p>RJ: We are making ember an addon soon, 2.4 or 2.5 and we should make sure the name does not conflict</p>
<p>YK+MB: Let’s roll with “ember-core” as a tentative name so we don’t block progress</p>
<p><strong>Docs Translation</strong></p>
<p>LS: I don’t want to be overly optimistic, but it is underway. I wanted to write up an RFP, still need to do it. We have Japanese, Chinese, Portuguese. The initial burst is nice, 3% on the Brazilian translation, 11% for Japanese. Workflow seems to be going well. Docs folks got it all rigged up, off the the races.</p>
<p>RJ: Is there a deployment plan?</p>
<p>LS: Locks and David B. are the people to ask, not completely sure.</p>
<p>RJ: I’ll ping them about it.</p>
