<h4 id="agenda">Agenda</h4>
<p>SP: is taking minutes (at the bottom of this page, feel free to help)</p>
<ul>
<li>SP: is using use-canvas (has beta invites)</li>
<li>this is a ember app!</li>
<li>somewhat normal markdown, but still WIP</li>
</ul>
<p>SP: at google continuing the effort with Ron on the HTMLBars security/XSS document</p>
<ul>
<li>transposing the document to markdown + private GH repo for ease of development</li>
<li>splitting the document into several more focused documents</li>
<li>our goal today is a easier to consume more actionable document</li>
</ul>
<p>SP &amp; EF: IE8 enables Ember[properties] to be lazy!</p>
<p>MB: Have discussed a splat syntax for component args w/ mmun and Kris (and some other yappers):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;my-comp *someHash as |yielded|&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>{{my-comp *someHash someProp=override}}</code></li>
<li><code>{{my-comp save=(some-helper *foo)}}</code></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="wycats">@wycats</span> is nervous about adding new microsyntax to HTML without a great deal of thought and care. Also, shouldn’t this be <code>...someHash</code> for compliance with JS splatting (<code>*</code> is more of a Ruby thing)</p>
<p>RJ: “Urgent” RFCs</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/68">ES6 Modules</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/65">Deprecation / Warning Handlers</a></li>
<li>Pods (urgent <span class="citation" data-cites="wycats">@wycats</span>/<span class="citation" data-cites="tomdale">@tomdale</span>? TODO)</li>
</ul>
<p>RJ: “Urgent” 1.13 Issues</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/11549">{{each}} fails with duplicate items</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/11539">No cleanup of route views</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/11519">infinite loop</a></li>
</ul>
<h5 id="lts-concerns">LTS Concerns?</h5>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="wycats">@wycats</span> doesn’t feel like the concerns specifically about the LTS are community-wide. It’s more people using the LTS release RFC as an opportunity to express concerns about the 2.0 churn. That said, there are some very real issues related to our aggressiveness in the 2.0 cycle that we should keep in mind going forward, and especially for 3.0. Hopefully the tooling situation will be better by the time we reach 3.0 too.</p>
<h5 id="npm-3-is-beta-tested">NPM 3 is beta tested</h5>
<h5 id="rfcs-to-discuss">RFCS to discuss</h5>
<p><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/pull/65">#65 - Deprecation Warning Handlers</a> seem uncontroversial at this point. tl;dr is that multiple handler functions can be registered to handle deprecations and warnings. Consumers will be Ember during tests, Ember-Data, Ember-Inspector, and an addon Robert is working on. I would like to merge this today/tomorrow and unblock people from doing the work needed to land it in time for 2.1.</p>
<h4 id="prs-to-discuss">PRs to discuss</h4>

<ul>
<li>4% of iOS users have Safari 6.x</li>
<li>iOS 6.1 apparently fixed this, trying to track down a machine (don’t want to install the old xCode)</li>
<li>if 6.1 fixes it, can we remove this?</li>
<li>code-size + extra debugging pain on some platforms, and that annoying extra throw/catch on boot.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11513">#11513 - Move away from ArrayComputed/ReduceComputed #11513</a></p>
<ul>
<li>converts AC/RC to simple CP’s</li>
<li>drops support for custom AC/RC macros, users can just use array methods thanks to glimmer</li>
<li>needs more people trying it out</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11479">#11484 - CLEANUP beta Remove object controller</a></p>

<h4 id="minutes">Minutes</h4>
<p>Attendees: Alex, Edward, Kris, Martin, Robert, Leah, Trek, Stef, Yehuda, Tom, Matthew, Igor</p>
<p>Discussed further bug fix releases in 1.13.x</p>
<p>pending blog post to help communicate this</p>
<p>pods RFC needs to land</p>
<p>each fails with duplicate items, quick fix (useful error), but real fix will land in 1.13.x soon</p>
<p>tricky problem, kris feels the more involved binning approach will solve it, it will be implemented and then back-ported to 1.13.x (wycats, mmun and krisselden all believe that the binning approach cannot break any existing working cases)</p>
<p>rob will release 1.13.3 with the improved error message this weekend. Error message will include information that we will be fixing in a future 1.13.x release</p>
<p>route views don’t appear to be cleaned up in 1.13 (<code>willDestroyElement</code>) is never called EF4 will take a look. RW will provide a concise JSBIN</p>
<p>RW: used yielded block params changing, can cause infinite loop and crash.</p>
<p>MM: ^ <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/11519">emberjs/ember.js/#11519</a></p>
<p>KS: hacked around, feels its related to components wanting to set internal state. Causing unwanted backflow. 2 way binding issue.</p>
<p>RW: issues contain good info, someone needs to dig in. TD / YK will look into this.</p>
<p>SP: memory leaks appear to still need to be issues</p>
<p>RW: view destruction is part of it</p>
<p>SP: yes, also appears attrNodes can leak</p>
<p>KS: attrNodes leaked associated with container views</p>
<p>YK: will be fixed soon, but requires the energy of very specific people.</p>
<p>RW: new fork for IE8 safe HTMLBars, be aware</p>
<p>SP: I can look into <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/issues/11501">emberjs/ember.js#11501</a></p>
<p>deprecations are numerous</p>
<p>how can we make it nice?</p>
<p>YK: improve categorization of RFC</p>
<p>Until <some version> attribute to deprecation messages should help convey the priority, and facilitate a better workflow</p>
<p>YK will add extra meta data</p>
<p>ES6-module API deferred to 2.1, merely just because of time constraints today</p>
<p>RW: <code>Ember.View.views</code> comes back as a deprecation, PR catches a bug and needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>land <a href="https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/11468">emberjs/ember.js#11468</a> just get tests working (rob has it)</p>
