<ul>
<li>DG: There are several new issues raised: https://gist.github.com/dgeb/20127d3fa1199426e59e60b9cdf20b43</li>
<li>re: dash prefix, we have some internal discussion backing up this decision that we should communicate. Precedence seems an ok point of view to take.</li>
<li>We will go back to the strike team for discussion and re-enter FCP after some discussion.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="docs-items">Docs items</h4>
<p>LS: There are some notes from <span class="citation" data-cites="locks">@locks</span> we need someone to get back on. I have an update for the website that is about to go live with changes to the tomsters page, the corporate tomsters as well.</p>
<p>SP: Do we have tomsters for training stuff? that say “unofficial”</p>
<p>LS: I will ponder. It seems odd to say “unofficial”, as that devalues the official stuff. Also corporations like LinkedIn aren’t really selling into Ember, like training is.</p>
