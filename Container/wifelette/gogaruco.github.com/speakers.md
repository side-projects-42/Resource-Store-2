#### Sarah Allen

<span class="speaker-highlight">Blazing Cloud</span> **Session: Test-First Teaching**

Sarah leads a small consulting group, Blazing Cloud, and is working on a mobile-focused startup, Mightyverse. She regularly teaches Ruby and Rails with a test-first approach. In her spare time, Sarah works to diversify the Ruby on Rails community with a focus on outreach to women through the RailsBridge Open Workshop project. In keeping with her belief that programming is a life skill, she also regularly volunteers teaching programming to kids. Sarah used to be active on the OpenLaszlo core team before she became distracted with Ruby. You can blame her for some of the web's most annoying and least testable features, since she was largely responsible for bringing Shockwave and Flash video into the world. She blogs at ultrasaurus.com and tweets as @ultrasaurus.

#### Avi Bryant

<span class="speaker-highlight">Smallthought</span> **Session: Rails is Obsolete (But So's Everything Else)**

Avi Bryant spoke at the first RubyConf, in 2001, then wandered away for a decade to help build a web framework (Seaside), product (Dabble DB) and company (Smallthought) on top of Smalltalk. When Smallthought was acquired by Twitter, he was abruptly pulled back to both Ruby and the Bay Area, and looks forward to enjoying both.
