### Session Descriptions

#### Keynote: (Parenthetically Speaking)

**Jim Weirich**

In any discussion on how to improve your programming skills, one book gets more recommendations than any other: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) by Abelson and Sussman. SICP was the introductory computer science text at MIT for many years. But how much could a professional developer really learn from a first year CS book?

Last fall I embarked on an adventure and invited folks to join me in a weekly study of SICP. We worked the examples and compared our answers. I am here today to share what mind-blowing concepts we discovered in just the first two chapters of SICP. Expect to see some Ruby code like you've never seen before.

#### Test-First Teaching

**Sarah Allen, Alex Chaffee**

We've all learned that writing tests before code is a great way to develop software. It turns out that it's also a great way to learn how to develop software in the first place! In this talk we discuss a number of projects that have used test-first approaches to teach Ruby, including Ruby Koans, RailsBridge Workshops, Wolfram Arnold's BFT (behavior-first teaching), Blazing Cloud JavaScript and Rails classes, plus our own open-source Learn Ruby TFT (test-first teaching) curriculum (at testfirst.org). Come hear about our experiences or share your own.

#### Rails is Obsolete (But So's Everything Else)

**Avi Bryant**

Back in the old days, you submitted a form to some URL and you got back some HTML. These days, you probably didn't hit submit, your URL probably didn't change, and what you got back was probably JSON—but you never saw it because it came in asynchronously in the background. Best practices around web applications are changing fast, driven by new browser standards, sophisticated JavaScript libraries and super fast JavaScript implementations. Why would a web framework design from 2004 still be appropriate? What can we be doing to adapt, or reinvent, our approaches to building web apps?
