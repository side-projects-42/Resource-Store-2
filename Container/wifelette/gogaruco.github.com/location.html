        <h4>After Party!</h4>

        <p class="normal-text">
          Conference Platinum Sponsor Yammer will be hosting a fantastic after
          party at ThirstyBear Brewing Co, a great local spot in the SOMA part
          of town.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
          The party starts at 6:30, and will feature a wide variety of
          appetizers and snacks, as well as an open bar. A shuttle will be
          provided from the conference to ThirstyBear for those of you who
          aren't driving, and, important to note, you WILL need your conference
          badge to gain entry to the event. Separate registration is not
          required.
        </p>
        <h4>Lodging</h4>

        <p class="normal-text">
          If you're looking for a place to stay, you might try one of these
          hotels listed here. There aren't any good places to stay near the
          conference center, so we recommend staying in the Union Square /
          Downtown area. It's easy to take MUNI to the conference from any of
          the Market Street subway stations.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
          GoGaRuCo has no official connection to any of these hotels, and there
          is no conference rate being offered. We're just providing this list as
          a convenience to help visitors.
