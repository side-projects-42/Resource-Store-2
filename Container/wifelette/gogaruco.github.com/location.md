**Driving from the East Bay/Bay Bridge:** After crossing the Bay Bridge, exit at Fifth Street and turn left onto Harrison. Go one block, then turn left on 6th Street. Turn right on Brannan, left on 7th and go straight until 16th Street. Then turn left on 16th Street and left onto Owens Street.

**Driving from the North Bay/Golden Gate Bridge:** After crossing the Golden Gate Bridge, drive east on 101 (Doyle Drive) towards downtown and exit at Marina Boulevard; follow Marina Boulevard past Fort Mason. Turn left onto Bay Street, then right onto the Embarcadero. After passing under the Bay Bridge, the Embarcadero will become King Street. Turn left onto 3rd Street just past AT&T Baseball Park.

#### After Party!

Conference Platinum Sponsor Yammer will be hosting a fantastic after party at ThirstyBear Brewing Co, a great local spot in the SOMA part of town.

The party starts at 6:30, and will feature a wide variety of appetizers and snacks, as well as an open bar. A shuttle will be provided from the conference to ThirstyBear for those of you who aren't driving, and, important to note, you WILL need your conference badge to gain entry to the event. Separate registration is not required.

#### Lodging

If you're looking for a place to stay, you might try one of these hotels listed here. There aren't any good places to stay near the conference center, so we recommend staying in the Union Square / Downtown area. It's easy to take MUNI to the conference from any of the Market Street subway stations.

GoGaRuCo has no official connection to any of these hotels, and there is no conference rate being offered. We're just providing this list as a convenience to help visitors.
