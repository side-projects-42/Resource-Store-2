#### OPower

OPOWER is an industry-leading software-as-a-service energy efficiency company. Our goal is to help ordinary people find easy ways to save energy on their utility bills. Our passion is making an unprecedented impact on the health of our planet. With our innovative software platform that combines sophisticated data analytics and cutting-edge behavioral science, we empower utility customers to save massive amounts of energy and money while significantly reducing global carbon emissions.

We partnered with our first utility client in 2007 from a rented desk in San Francisco. Since then, we've grown into a well-capitalized business with over 200 employees and a product platform that now reaches more than 10 million homes in North America. Our all-star team of software engineers, product specialists, behavioral scientists, statisticians, marketing experts, infographic designers, and efficiency advocates are directly responsible for the enormous positive impact we’ve had to date: we’ve cumulatively saved Americans more than $35 million and enough energy to power nearly 50,000 homes in perpetuity—equivalent to one-third of the entire US solar industry.

#### Heroku

Heroku (pronounced her-OH-koo) is a cloud application platform – a new way of building and deploying web apps. Developers can focus 100% on code and never think about servers, instances, or VMs again. Heroku lets you run any application from simple to complex, from Ruby to Node.JS.

Heroku takes full responsibility for your app's health, keeping it up and running through thick and thin, while you manage and command your app with a full set of control surface APIs.

Tens of thousands of developers have deployed hundreds of thousands of apps to Heroku already.
