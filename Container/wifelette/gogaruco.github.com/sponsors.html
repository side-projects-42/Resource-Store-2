            <h4>OPower</h4>
            <p>
              OPOWER is an industry-leading software-as-a-service energy
              efficiency company. Our goal is to help ordinary people find easy
              ways to save energy on their utility bills. Our passion is making
              an unprecedented impact on the health of our planet. With our
              innovative software platform that combines sophisticated data
              analytics and cutting-edge behavioral science, we empower utility
              customers to save massive amounts of energy and money while
              significantly reducing global carbon emissions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We partnered with our first utility client in 2007 from a rented
              desk in San Francisco. Since then, we've grown into a
              well-capitalized business with over 200 employees and a product
              platform that now reaches more than 10 million homes in North
              America. Our all-star team of software engineers, product
              specialists, behavioral scientists, statisticians, marketing
              experts, infographic designers, and efficiency advocates are
              directly responsible for the enormous positive impact we’ve had to
              date: we’ve cumulatively saved Americans more than $35 million and
              enough energy to power nearly 50,000 homes in
              perpetuity—equivalent to one-third of the entire US solar
              industry.

            <h4>Heroku</h4>
            <p>
              Heroku (pronounced her-OH-koo) is a cloud application platform – a
              new way of building and deploying web apps. Developers can focus
              100% on code and never think about servers, instances, or VMs
              again. Heroku lets you run any application from simple to complex,
              from Ruby to Node.JS.
            </p>

            <p>
              Heroku takes full responsibility for your app's health, keeping it
              up and running through thick and thin, while you manage and
              command your app with a full set of control surface APIs.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tens of thousands of developers have deployed hundreds of
              thousands of apps to Heroku already.
