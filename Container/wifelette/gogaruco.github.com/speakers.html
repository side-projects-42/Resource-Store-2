              Jim Weirich is the Chief Scientist for EdgeCase LLC, a Rails
              development firm located in Columbus Ohio. Jim has over
              twenty-five years of experience in software development. He has
              worked with real-time data systems for testing jet engines,
              networking software for information systems, and image processing
              software for the financial industry. Jim is active in the Ruby
              community and has contributed to several Ruby projects, including
              the Rake build system and the RubyGems package software.

              <strong>Session: Test-First Teaching</strong>
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
              Sarah leads a small consulting group, Blazing Cloud, and is
              working on a mobile-focused startup, Mightyverse. She regularly
              teaches Ruby and Rails with a test-first approach. In her spare
              time, Sarah works to diversify the Ruby on Rails community with a
              focus on outreach to women through the RailsBridge Open Workshop
              project. In keeping with her belief that programming is a life
              skill, she also regularly volunteers teaching programming to kids.
              Sarah used to be active on the OpenLaszlo core team before she
              became distracted with Ruby. You can blame her for some of the
              web's most annoying and least testable features, since she was
              largely responsible for bringing Shockwave and Flash video into
              the world. She blogs at ultrasaurus.com and tweets as
              @ultrasaurus.

              Avi Bryant spoke at the first RubyConf, in 2001, then wandered
              away for a decade to help build a web framework (Seaside), product
              (Dabble DB) and company (Smallthought) on top of Smalltalk. When
              Smallthought was acquired by Twitter, he was abruptly pulled back
              to both Ruby and the Bay Area, and looks forward to enjoying both.
