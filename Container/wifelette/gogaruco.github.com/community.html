            <p class="normal-text">
              If you've been to a Ruby or jQuery conference in the last few
              years, you've likely seen Leah there. When she's not traveling the
              world seeking out the perfect conference, she's here in San
              Francisco working on other open source community projects, like
              the Ruby Summer of Code. She is currently employed by appendTo.

            <h4>Josh Susser</h4>
            <p class="normal-text">
              Josh likes to say that Ruby is the love child of Lisp and
              Smalltalk, raised by Perl the eccentric nanny. At Pivotal Labs he
              spends most of his time developing Rails web applications for
              clients, and he is a high-ranked contributor to the Rails open
              source project. He has spoken at RailsConf, regional conferences
              and meetups. In past lives he's done Smalltalk VM implementation,
              spent too much time at Apple building the ill-fated OpenDoc, and
              helped design the Java VM that runs on the SIM card in your
              iPhone. You can find his blog at blog.hasmanythrough.com.

            <h4>Jim Meyer</h4>
            <p class="normal-text">
              Jim Meyer (@purp) is a perpetual n00b who blames both Ruby and
              Rails for his sleep deficit dating back to May of ‘07. He’s
              particularly delighted to join a community where agility is
              valued, iteration is key, and testing is cool.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
              With a career that’s ranged from freelance graphic design to large
              scale distributed computing systems architecture to leading
              technology organizations large and small, Jim is a renaissance
              man, a geek of all trades, or (most likely) an advanced case of
              ADD in search of the next challenging distraction. Along the way,
              he’s founded a graphic design studio, built technology groups and
              solutions for the likes of Disney and DreamWorks, met many
              interesting people and had a metric ton of fun.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
              Jim is the father of two and husband of one, all three of whom
              make him a better person on a daily basis (and none of whom speak
              in third person).
