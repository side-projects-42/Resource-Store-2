# Arrow Function Shorthand

## Introduction

The original style for declaring functions in JavaScript is the _function
declaration_.

```js
function foo() {
  return "bar";
}
```

But JavaScript has two other ways to write functions: the _function expression_
and the _arrow function_. None of these is more correct or better than others,
but learning to recognize the correct situation in which to use each is a useful
skill for a programmer.

## Learning Goals

- Declare a function using a function expression
- Declare a function using an arrow function
- Describe situations where arrow functions are used

## Declare a Function Using a Function Expression

Thus far we've only ever used a _function declaration_:

```js
function foo() {
  return "bar";
}
```

A function can also be written:

```js
let foo = function () {
  return "bar";
};
```

The `function() {...}` to the right of the assignment operator (`=`) is called
a _function expression_. The best way to understand what a function expression
is is by analogy.

```js
let sum = 1 + 1;
```

Evaluate the expression `1 + 1`, returning `2` and assign it to the variable `sum`

```js
let difference = 10 - 1;
```

Evaluate the expression `10 - 1`, returning `9` and assign it to the variable
`difference`.

```js
let foo = function () {
  return "bar";
};
```

Evaluate the expression `function() { return 'bar' }`, returning a thing that
can be called and assign it to the variable `foo`. The function expression
(again, the thing to the right of `=`) is known as "an anonymous function." It
doesn't have a name associated with it like you see in a _function
declaration_.

However, when we assign an anonymous function to a name (that is, a variable),
we have a name that points to a callable thing. We _could_ call this anonymous
function by invoking `foo()`. That anonymous function is now, for all
reasonable purposes, named `foo`.

There are a few subtle differences between _function declarations_ and
_function expressions_, but they are very minute. Neither is really better than
the other. JavaScript supports variety, and you can use whichever one you prefer.

Try thinking about the following code. Will this work? Does it work? Try to
explain to yourself what's happening using the words "anonymous function" and
"`call`." If you need help, see [Immediately Invoked Function Expression][iife]
in the Resources section below.

```js
(function () {
  console.log("Hello world");
})();
```

## Declare a Function Using An Arrow Function

Around 2015, developers got tired of typing `f-u-n-c-t-i-o-n` over and over.
They lobbied the ECMAScript body for a way to write functions in a very short
way. Here is the result, the "Arrow Function."

```js
let add = (parameter1, parameter2) => parameter1 + parameter2;
add(2, 3); //=> 5
```

It seems like it wouldn't work, but it does. This builds on the syntax of the
_function expression_ just covered. The arrow syntax just lets you cut out a
some typing.

First, add is the name of a variable to which an _anonymous function_ is
assigned. Nothing new there. So, let's look to the right of the `=`.

```js
(parameter1, parameter2) => parameter1 + parameter2;
// Parameter list ^^^^^   // Function Body ^^^^^^^^
```

This is a very short function body! It adds `parameter1` and `parameter2`.
Without any braces, arrow functions automatically return the result of the last
expression. This recalls Ruby's _implicit return_ and is quite a departure for
JavaScript which has always required _explicit return_ with the `return`
keyword.

The parameters that the function takes looks similar to what we would have done
historically: list the parameters, separated by comma, inside of `()`.

If your arrow function has only one parameter, the `()` become optional around
the parameter:

```js
let twoAdder = (x) => x + 2;
// is the same as
let twoAdder = (x) => x + 2;
```

Almost all developers will drop the parentheses in this case.

If we need to do more work than return a single expression, we'll need `{}` to
wrap the multiple lines of code, **and** we'll have to declare a `return`. That
sweet no-`return` syntax is only available if your function body is one
expression long.

```js
let sum = (parameter1, parameter2) => {
  console.log(`Adding ${parameter1}`);
  console.log(`Adding ${parameter2}`);
  return parameter1 + parameter2;
};
sum(1, 2); //=> 3
```

## Describe Situations Where Arrow Functions Are Used

Using arrow functions often appears when using JavaScript's _iterator_ methods.
An iterator is a method that allows you to deal with a set of data one at a
time. For example, if you had a group of student's essays, you could only
grade them one at a time. An iterator method would allow you to do just that.

As a preview of advanced iteration in JavaScript, we'll show the `.map()`
method. `.map()` iterates through one `Array`, passes each element to a
function that's passed in as an argument, takes that functions return value,
and stacks it into a new array. Don't worry if you don't completely follow
everything that goes on here - we haven't covered iterators quite yet, so it's
totally OK if the finer details feel a bit murky.

```js
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
const squares = nums.map((x) => x ** 2); //=> [1,4,9]
const doubles = nums.map((x) => x * 2); //=> [2,4,6]
```

If all this math stuff seems a bit too textbook-y, be reassured that we can
iterate through anything, not just numbers. We can do something similar with DOM
elements:

```js
finishedItems = overdueTodoItems.map((item) => (item.className = "complete"));
header.innerText = `You finished ${finishedItems.length} items!`;
```

Or billing software:

```js
lapsedUserAccounts.map((u) => sendBillTo(u.address));
```

## Instructions

You are going to write several methods. Write your code in the `index.js` file.
Let the tests guide you through the process.

## Conclusion

In this lesson you saw two different styles for declaring functions: function
expressions and arrow functions. Neither is "better" than the standard function
declaration we've been using. Arrow functions excel when a simple change or
operation needs to be used repeatedly. But they're certainly used to write long,
full functions too! As you continue through the course, you'll see all three
methods used to write functions, and develop a sense of when to use each
yourself.
