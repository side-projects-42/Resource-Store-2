# Dice Roll

## Objectives

1. Write code within a method.
2. Get more practice returning values.
3. Explore number ranges.

## Ruby Ranges

In Ruby, a "range" is a set of values with a beginning and an end. A range can contain strings or integers. 

A range of strings: `("a", "b", "c", "d")`

A range of integers: `(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)`

A range can be constructed using this notation: `(100..200)`

Or this notation: `(100...200)`

Using a `..` ("double-dot") includes the second number (`200`) in the range, while using a `...` ("triple-dot") excludes it.

Ranges can be helpful when you are generating [arrays](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Array.html) which we will be learning more about soon.  

##Instructions 

Inside the `dice_roll.rb` file, define a method `roll` that returns a random number between one (1) and six (6).

**Hint:** *Try to googling "how to generate a random number in ruby".*


##Bonus

There are different ways to complete this lab. First, try to solve it by using ranges. Then for some extra fun, try to solve this lab using an array. 

**Hint:** *Think about how you can grab a random element out of an array.*
