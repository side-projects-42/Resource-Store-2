## Objectives

Create a checkout method to calculate the total cost of a cart of items and apply discounts and coupons as necessary.

Dr. Steve Bruhle, your green grocer, isn't ready, but you are!

## Instructions

Implement a method `checkout` to calculate total cost of a cart of items and apply discounts and coupons as necessary. The checkout method will rely on the `consolidate_cart`, `apply_coupons`, and the `apply_clearance` methods.

#### The `consolidate_cart` method

The cart starts as an array of individual items. Translate it into a hash that includes the counts for each item with the `consolidate_cart` method.

For instance, if the method is given the array below:

```ruby
[
  {"AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => true }},
  {"AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => true }},
  {"KALE"    => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => false}}
]
```

then the method should return the hash below:

```ruby
{
  "AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => true, :count => 2},
  "KALE"    => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => false, :count => 1}
}
```

#### The `apply_coupons` method

If the method is given a cart that looks like this:

```ruby
{
  "AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => true, :count => 3},
  "KALE"    => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => false, :count => 1}
}
```

and a coupon for avocados that looks like this:

```ruby
[{:item => "AVOCADO", :num => 2, :cost => 5.0}]

```

then `apply_coupons` should return the following hash:

```
{
  "AVOCADO" => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => true, :count => 1},
  "KALE"    => {:price => 3.0, :clearance => false, :count => 1},
  "AVOCADO W/COUPON" => {:price => 5.0, :clearance => true, :count => 1},
}
```

Notice how there were three avocados in the cart, but the coupon only applied to two of them. This left one un-couponed avocado in the cart at $3.00 and one "bundle" of discounted avocados totalling $5.00.

#### The `apply_clearance` method

This method should discount the price of every item on clearance by twenty percent.

For instance, if this method was given this cart:

```ruby
{
  "PEANUTBUTTER" => {:price => 3.00, :clearance => true,  :count => 2},
  "KALE"         => {:price => 3.00, :clearance => false, :count => 3}
  "SOY MILK"     => {:price => 4.50, :clearance => true,  :count => 1}
}
```

it should return a cart with clearance applied to peanutbutter and soy milk:

```ruby
{
  "PEANUTBUTTER" => {:price => 2.40, :clearance => true,  :count => 2},
  "KALE"         => {:price => 3.00, :clearance => false, :count => 3}
  "SOY MILK"     => {:price => 3.60, :clearance => true,  :count => 1}
}
```

### The `checkout` method

Create a `checkout` method that calculates the total cost of the consolidated cart.

When checking out, follow these steps _in order_:

- Apply coupon discounts if the proper number of items are present.

- Apply 20% discount if items are on clearance.

- If, after applying the coupon discounts and the clearance discounts, the cart's total is over $100, then apply a 10% discount.

### Named Parameters

The method signature for the checkout method is
`consolidate_cart(cart:[])`. This, along with the checkout method uses a ruby 2.0 feature called [Named Parameters](http://brainspec.com/blog/2012/10/08/keyword-arguments-ruby-2-0/).

Named parameters give you more expressive code since you are specifying what each parameter is for. Another benefit is the order you pass your parameters doesn't matter!
`checkout(cart: [], coupons: [])` is the same as `checkout(coupons: [], cart: [])`
