## Authenticated Usage

### Seamless authentication using .gitconfig defaults

You will need a `~/.gitconfig` file in place with a `[github]` section

See: http://github.com/guides/tell-git-your-user-name-and-email-address

### Specify authentication at the command line

If you don't have a `[github]` section set up in your `~/.gitconfig` file, you
can provide your user name and Github API at the command line.
