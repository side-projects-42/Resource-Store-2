# This gem has been DEPRECATED

This code was meant to be a convenience wrapper on ActiveResource classes
to provide a nice resource based API. It's based on an older version
of our API's. Since then we've created a much richer REST API with complete
documentation and examples.

Here are some references for version 2 of our REST API:

- [Detailed documentation on the V2 data API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apis)
- [The V2 API Explorer](https://rpm.newrelic.com/api/explore)
- [Documentation on the API Explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/apis/api-explorer-v2/getting-started-new-relics-api-explorer)

The original README file for this gem can be found [here](README-old.rdoc)
