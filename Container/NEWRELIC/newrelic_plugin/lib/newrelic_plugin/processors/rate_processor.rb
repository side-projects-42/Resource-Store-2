  # OBSOLESCENCE WARNING!!!
  #
  # The "Rate" processor is being obsoleted. Please do not use in any new agent
  # development.
  #
  # If you feel you need this processor, please check out the "Epoch Counter" processor
  # and see if that will meet your needs. If not, then you can always do this calculation
  # yourself within your agent.
  #
  # This processor will be removed from the code base shortly...
