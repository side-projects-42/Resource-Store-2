Account Maturity for New Relic One is a quick view that helps you understand what key features of your New Relic account you're using across multiple accounts and applications. It uses the power of the [NerdGraph API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/nerdgraph/get-started/introduction-new-relic-nerdgraph) to explore the account structure and provide detailed information for master and subaccounts, and their usage.
