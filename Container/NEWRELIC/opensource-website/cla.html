      INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTOR LICENSE AGREEMENT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in contributing to the open source projects of
      New Relic, Inc. (“New Relic”). In order to clarify the intellectual
      property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, New
      Relic must have a Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) on file that
      has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license
      terms below. This Agreement is for your protection as a Contributor as
      well as the protection of New Relic; it does not change your rights to use
      your own Contributions for any other purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your
      present and future Contributions submitted to New Relic. Except for the
      licenses granted herein to New Relic and recipients of software
      distributed by New Relic, You reserve all right, title, and interest in
      and to Your Contributions.
    </p>
    <h2 id="definitions.">Definitions.</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        “You” (or “Your”) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity
        authorized by the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement
        with New Relic. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and
        all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
        control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For
        the purposes of this definition, “control” means (i) the power, direct
        or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity,
        whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
        (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
        of such entity.
      </li>
      <li>
        “Contribution” shall mean any original work of authorship, including any
        modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally
        submitted by You to New Relic for inclusion in, or documentation of, any
        of the products managed or maintained by New Relic (the “Work”). For the
        purposes of this definition, “submitted” means any form of electronic,
        verbal, or written communication sent to New Relic or its
        representatives, including but not limited to communication on
        electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue
        tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, New Relic for the
        purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding
        communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in
        writing by You as “Not a Contribution.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, You hereby grant to New Relic and to recipients of software
        distributed by New Relic a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        no-charge, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable copyright license to
        reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly
        perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such
        derivative works.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
        Agreement, You hereby grant to New Relic and to recipients of software
        distributed by New Relic a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
        no-charge, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable (except as stated in
        this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell,
        sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
        applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are
        necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of
        Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any
        other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
        alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have
        contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement,
        then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for
        that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
        is filed.
      </li>
      <li>
        You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses.
        If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create
        that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received
        permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your
        employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to New Relic, or
        that Your employer has executed a separate Agreement with New Relic.
      </li>
      <li>
        You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation
        (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). You represent that
        Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any
        third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to,
        related patents and trademarks) of which You are personally aware and
        which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except
        to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for
        free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or
        agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS”
        BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
        implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of
        TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE.
      </li>
      <li>
        Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You
        may submit it to New Relic separately from any Contribution, identifying
        the complete details of its source and of any license or other
        restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks,
        and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and
        conspicuously marking the work as “Submitted on behalf of a third-party:
        [named here]”.
      </li>
      <li>
        You agree to notify New Relic of any facts or circumstances of which You
        become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any
        respect.
