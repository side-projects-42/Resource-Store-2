### Get the sources

    # using git is preferred
    git clone https://github.com/sass/libsass.git
    # only needed for sassc and/or testsuite
    git clone https://github.com/sass/sassc.git libsass/sassc
    git clone https://github.com/sass/sass-spec.git libsass/sass-spec

### Decide for static or shared library

`libsass` can be built and linked as a `static` or as a `shared` library. The default is `static`. To change it you can set the `BUILD` environment variable:

    export BUILD="shared"

Alternatively you can also define it directly when calling make:

    BUILD="shared" make ...

### Compile the library

    make -C libsass -j5

### Results can be found in

    $ ls libsass/lib
    libsass.a libsass.so

### Install onto the system

We recommend to use [autotools to install](build-with-autotools.md) libsass onto the system, since that brings all the benefits of using libtools as the main install method. If you still want to install libsass via the makefile, you need to make sure that gnu `install` utility (or compatible) is installed on your system.

    yum install coreutils # RedHat Linux
    emerge -a coreutils # Gentoo Linux
    pkgin install coreutils # SmartOS

You can set the install location by setting `PREFIX`

    PREFIX="/opt/local" make install

### Compling sassc

    # Let build know library location
    export SASS_LIBSASS_PATH="`pwd`/libsass"
    # Invokes the sassc makefile
    make -C libsass -j5 sassc

### Run the spec test-suite

    # needs ruby available
    # also gem install minitest
    make -C libsass -j5 test_build
