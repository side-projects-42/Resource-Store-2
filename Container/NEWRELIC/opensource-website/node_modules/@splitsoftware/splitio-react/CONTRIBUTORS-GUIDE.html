<p>For widespread use of the SDK with different environments and module formats, we have three different builds: * A bundled <strong>UMD</strong> file. * A <strong>ES2015</strong> modules compatible build. * A <strong>CommonJS</strong> modules compatible build.</p>
<p>The different builds can be generated all at once with the command <code>npm run build</code>. Refer to <a href="package.json">package.json</a> for more insight on the build scripts.</p>
<h3 id="running-tests">Running tests</h3>
<p>All tests can be run at once with the command <code>npm run test</code>.</p>
<p>For additional testing scripts, refer to our <a href="package.json">package.json</a> file.</p>
