<p>Utilities for determining whether characters belong to character classes defined by the XML specs.</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>It used to be that the library was contained in a single file and you could just import/require/what-have-you the <code>xmlchars</code> module. However, that setup did not work well for people who cared about code optimization. Importing <code>xmlchars</code> meant importing <em>all</em> of the library and because of the way the code was generated there was no way to shake the resulting code tree.</p>
<p>Different modules cover different standards. At the time this documentation was last updated, we had:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>xmlchars/xml/1.0/ed5</code> which covers XML 1.0 edition 5.</li>
<li><code>xmlchars/xml/1.0/ed4</code> which covers XML 1.0 edition 4.</li>
<li><code>xmlchars/xml/1.1/ed2</code> which covers XML 1.0 edition 2.</li>
<li><code>xmlchars/xmlns/1.0/ed3</code> which covers XML Namespaces 1.0 edition 3.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>The “things” each module contains can be categorized as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“Fragments”: these are parts and pieces of regular expressions that correspond to the productions defined in the standard that the module covers. You’d use these to <em>build regular expressions</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Regular expressions that correspond to the productions defined in the standard that the module covers.</p></li>
<li><p>Lists: these are arrays of characters that correspond to the productions.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions that test code points to verify whether they fit a production.</p></li>
</ol>
