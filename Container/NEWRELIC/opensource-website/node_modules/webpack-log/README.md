webpack-log
===========

A common logging module for the Webpack ecosystem. `webpack-log` leverages [`loglevelnext`](https://github.com/shellscape/loglevelnext).

Getting Started
---------------

First thingâ€™s first, install the module:

    npm install webpack-log --save

*Note: We do not recommend installing this module globally.*

Requirements
------------

`webpack-log` requires Node v6 or higher.

Usage
-----

    const weblog = require('webpack-log');
    const log = weblog({ name: 'wds' }) // webpack-dev-server

    log.info('Server Starting');

The code above will produce:

Options
-------

The default export (`function`) will return a logger, given an `options` Object. The following is a property reference for the Object.

*Note: the logger returned is unique by default, due to the nature of the `webpack` ecosystem. Please reference the [`unique`](#unique) option below for disabling this feature and to force caching.*

### level

Type: `String`  
Default: `'info'`

Specifies the level the logger should use. A logger will not produce output for any log level *beneath* the specified level. Available levels and order are:

    [
      'trace',
      'debug',
      'info',
      'warn',
      'error',
      'silent'
    ]

*Note: The level names shown above correspond to the available logging methods, with the notable exception of the `silent` level.*

### name

*Required*  
Type: `String`  
Default: `'<unknown>'`

Specifies the name of the log to create. This property is required, and used to differentiate between loggers when `webpack-log` is used in multiple projects executing in the same process space.

### timestamp

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `false`

If `true`, instructs the logger to display a timestamp for log output, preceding all other data.

### unique

Type: `Boolean`  
Default: `true`

If `false`, instructs the logger to used cached versions of a log with the same name. Due to the nature of the `webpack` ecosystem and multiple plugin/loader use in the same process space, loggers are created as unique instances by default. By passing `false` for this property, the module is instructed to cache the requested logger.
