> The safe way to handle the `connect` socket event

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/szmarczak/defer-to-connect/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/szmarczak/defer-to-connect?branch=master)

Once you receive the socket, it may be already connected (or disconnected).  
To avoid checking that, use `defer-to-connect`. It’ll do that for you.

Usage
-----

    const deferToConnect = require('defer-to-connect');

    deferToConnect(socket, () => {
        console.log('Connected!');
    });

API
---

### deferToConnect(socket, connectListener)

Calls `connectListener()` when connected.

### deferToConnect(socket, listeners)

#### listeners

An object representing `connect`, `secureConnect` and `close` properties.

Calls `connect()` when the socket is connected.  
Calls `secureConnect()` when the socket is securely connected.
