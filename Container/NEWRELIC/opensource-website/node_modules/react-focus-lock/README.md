It is a trap! We got your focus and will not let him out!

-   Modal dialogs. You can not leave it with ‚ÄúTab‚Äù, ie do a ‚Äútab-out‚Äù.
-   Focused tasks. It will aways brings you back, as you can ‚Äúlock‚Äù user inside a component.
-   Any any other case, when you have to lock user *intention* and *focus*, if that‚Äôs what `a11y` is asking for.

Features
========

-   no keyboard control, everything is done watching a **focus behavior**, not emulating it. Thus works always and everywhere.
-   React **Portals** support. Even if some data is in outer space - it is [still in lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/issues/19).
-   *Scattered* locks, or focus lock groups - you can setup different isolated locks, and *tab* from one to another.
-   Controllable isolation level.
-   variable size bundle. Uses sidecar to trim UI part to 1.5kb.

> üí° **focus** locks is only the first part, there are also **scroll lock** and **text-to-speech** lock you have to use to really ‚Äúlock‚Äù the user. Try [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) to archive everything above, assembled in the right order.

How to use
==========

Just wrap something with focus lock, and focus will be `moved inside` on mount.

     import FocusLock from 'react-focus-lock';

     const JailForAFocus = ({onClose}) => (
        <FocusLock>
          You can not leave this form
          <button onClick={onClose} />
        </FocusLock>
     );

WHY?
====

From [MDN Article about accessible dialogs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_dialog_role): - The dialog must be properly labeled - Keyboard **focus must be managed** correctly

This one is about managing the focus.

I‚Äôve got a good [article about focus management, dialogs and WAI-ARIA](https://medium.com/@antonkorzunov/its-a-focus-trap-699a04d66fb5).

API
===

> FocusLock would work perfectly even with no props set.

FocusLock has few props to tune behavior, all props are optional: - `disabled`, to disable(enable) behavior without altering the tree. - `returnFocus`, to return focus into initial position on unmount(not disable). &gt; By default `returnFocus` is disabled, so FocusLock will **not** restore original focus on deactivation.

This is expected behavior for Modals, but it is better to implement it by your self. See [unmounting and focus management](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock#unmounting-and-focus-management) for details - `persistentFocus=false`, requires any element to be focused. This also disables text selections inside, and **outside** focus lock. - `autoFocus=true`, enables or disables focusing into on Lock activation. If disabled Lock will blur an active focus. - `noFocusGuards=false` disabled *focus guards* - virtual inputs which secure tab index. - `group='''` named focus group for focus scattering aka [combined lock targets](https://github.com/theKashey/vue-focus-lock/issues/2) - `shards=[]` an array of `ref` pointing to the nodes, which focus lock should consider and a part of it. This is another way focus scattering.  
- `whiteList=fn` you could *whitelist* locations FocusLock should carry about. Everything outside it will ignore. For example - any modals. - `as='div'` if you need to change internal `div` element, to any other. Use ref forwarding to give FocusLock the node to work with. - `lockProps={}` to pass any extra props (except className) to the internal wrapper.

### Focusing in OSX (Safari/Firefox) is strange!

By default `tabbing` in OSX `sees` only controls, but not links or anything else `tabbable`. This is system settings, and Safari/Firefox obey. Press Option+Tab in Safari to loop across all tabbables, or change the Safari settings. There is no way to *fix* Firefox, unless change system settings (Control+F7). See [this issue](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/issues/24) for more information.

Set up
------

### Requirements

-   version 1x is React 15/16 compatible
-   version 2+ requires React 16.8+ (hooks) \#\#\# Import `react-focus-lock` exposed **3 entry points**: for the classical usage, and a *sidecar* one. \#\#\#\# Default usage
-   4kb, `import FocusLock from 'react-focus-lock` would give you component you are looking for.

#### Separated usage

Meanwhile - you dont need any focus related logic until it‚Äôs needed. Thus - you may defer that logic till Lock activation and move all related code to a *sidecar*.

-   UI, **1.5kb**, `import FocusLockUI from 'react-focus-lock/UI` - a DOM part of a lock.
-   Sidecar, 3.5kb, `import Sidecar from 'react-focus-lock/sidecar` - which is the real focus lock.

    import FocusLockUI from "react-focus-lock/UI";
    import {sidecar} from "use-sidecar";

    // prefetch sidecar. data would be loaded, but js would not be executed
    const FocusLockSidecar = sidecar(  
      () => import(/* webpackPrefetch: true */ "react-focus-lock/sidecar")
    );

    <FocusLockUI
        disabled={this.state.disabled}
        sideCar={FocusLockSidecar}
    >
     {content}
    </FocusLockUI> 

That would split FocusLock into two pieces, reducing app size and improving the first load. The cost of focus-lock is just 1.5kb!

> Saved 3.5kb?! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 3.5kb here and 3.5kb here, and your 20mb bundle is ready.

Autofocus
=========

Use when you cannot use the native `autoFocus` prop - because you only want to autofocus once the Trap has been activated

-   prop `data-autofocus` on the element.
-   prop `data-autofocus-inside` on the element to focus on something inside.
-   `AutoFocusInside` component, as named export of this library.

     import FocusLock, { AutoFocusInside } from 'react-focus-lock';
     
     <FocusLock>
       <button>Click</button>
       <AutoFocusInside>
        <button>will be focused</button>
       </AutoFocusInside>
     </FocusLock>
     // is the same as
     
     <FocusLock>
       <button>Click</button>
        <button data-autofocus>will be focused</button>
     </FocusLock>

If there is more than one auto-focusable target - the first will be selected. If it is a part of radio group, and **rest of radio group element are also autofocusable**(just put them into AutoFocusInside) - checked one fill be selected.

`AutoFocusInside` will work only on Lock activation, and does nothing, then used outside of the lock. You can use `MoveFocusInside` to move focus inside with or without lock.

     import { MoveFocusInside } from 'react-focus-lock';
        
     <MoveFocusInside>
      <button>will be focused</button>
     </MoveFocusInside>

Portals
=======

Use focus scattering to handle portals

-   using `groups`. Just create a few locks (only one could be active) with a same group name

    const PortaledElement = () => (
       <FocusLock group="group42" disabled={true}>
         // "discoverable" portaled content
       </FocusLock>  
    );

    <FocusLock group="group42">
      // main content
    </FocusLock>

-   using `shards`. Just pass all the pieces to the ‚Äúshards‚Äù prop.

    const PortaledElement = () => (
       <div ref={ref}>
         // "discoverable" portaled content
       </div>  
    );

    <FocusLock shards={[ref]}>
      // main content
    </FocusLock>

-   without anything. FocusLock will not prevent focusing portaled element, but will not include them in to tab order

    const PortaledElement = () => (
       <div>
         // NON-"discoverable" portaled content
       </div>  
    );

    <FocusLock shards={[ref]}>
      // main content
      <PortaledElement />
    </FocusLock>

### Using your own `Components`

You may use `as` prop to change *what* Focus-Lock will render around `children`.

    <FocusLock as="section">
        <button>Click</button>
        <button data-autofocus>will be focused</button>
     </FocusLock>
     
     <FocusLock as={AnotherComponent} lockProps={{anyAnotherComponentProp: 4}}>
        <button>Click</button>
        <span>Hello there!</span>
     </FocusLock>

### Guarding

As you may know - FocusLock is adding `Focus Guards` before and after lock to remove some side effects, like page scrolling. But `shards` will not have such guards, and it might be not so cool to use them - for example if no `tabbable` would be defined after shard - you will tab to the browser chrome.

You may wrap shard with `InFocusGuard` or just drop `InFocusGuard` here and there - that would solve the problem.

    import {InFocusGuard} from 'react-focus-lock';

    // wrap with
    <InFocusGuard>
      <button />
    </InFocusGuard>

    // place before and after
    <InFocusGuard />
    <button />
    <InFocusGuard />

InFocusGuards would be active(tabbable) only when tabble, it protecting, is focused.

#### Removing Tailing Guard

If only your modal is the last tabble element on the body - you might remove the Tailing Guard, to allow user *tab* into address bar.

    <InFocusGuard/>
    <button />  
    // there is no "tailing" guard :)

Unmounting and focus management
===============================

-   In case FocusLock has `returnFocus` enabled, and it‚Äôs going to be unmounted - focus will be returned after zero-timeout.
-   In case `returnFocus` is set to `false`, and you are going to control focus change on your own - keep in mind &gt;&gt; React will first call Parent.componentWillUnmount, and next Child.componentWillUnmount

This means - Trap will be still active by the time you *may* want move(return) focus on componentWillUnmount. Please deffer this action with a zero-timeout.

Similarly, if you are using the `disabled` prop to control FocusLock, you will need a zero-timeout to correctly restore focus.

    <FocusLock
      disabled={isFocusLockDisabled}
      onDeactivation={() => {
        // Without the zero-timeout, focus will likely remain on the button/control
        // you used to set isFocusLockDisabled = true
        window.setTimeout(() => myRef.current.focus(), 0);
      }
    >

Return focus with no scroll
---------------------------

> read more at the [issue \#83](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/issues/83) or [mdn article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus).

To return focus, but without *jumpy* page scroll returning a focus you might specify a focus option

    <FocusLock
      returnFocus={{ preventScroll: false }} // working not in all browsers
    >   

Not supported by Edge and Safari.

Not only for React
==================

Uses [focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/focus-lock/) under the hood. It does also provide support for Vue.js and Vanilla DOM solutions

Warning!
========

Two different *focus-lock-managers* or even different version of a single one, active simultaneously will FIGHT!

**Focus-lock will surrender**, as long any other focus management library will not.

Focus fighting
--------------

You may wrap some render branch with `FreeFocusInside`, and react-focus-lock **will ignore** any focus inside marked node, thus landing a peace.

    import { FreeFocusInside } from 'react-focus-lock';

    <FreeFocusInside>
     <div id="portal-for-modals">
       in this div i am going to portal my modals, dont fight with them please
     </div>
    </FreeFocusInside>

Even the better is to `whiteList` FocusLock areas - for example ‚Äúyou should handle only React Stuff in React Root‚Äù

    <FocusLock whiteList={node => document.getElementById('root').contains(node)}>
     ...
    </FocusLock>

PS: **please use webpack or yarn resolution for force one version of react-focus-lock used**

> webpack.conf

     resolve: {    
        alias: {
          'react-focus-lock': path.resolve(path.join(__dirname, './node_modules/react-focus-lock'))
     ...

More
====

To create a ‚Äúright‚Äù modal dialog you have to: - manage a focus. Use this library - block document scroll. Use [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky). - hide everything else from screen readers. Use [aria-hidden](https://github.com/theKashey/aria-hidden)

You may use [react-focus-on](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-on) to archive everything above, assembled in the right order.
