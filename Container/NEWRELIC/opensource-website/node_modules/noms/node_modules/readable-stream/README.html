<p>This package is a mirror of the Streams2 and Streams3 implementations in Node-core.</p>
<p>If you want to guarantee a stable streams base, regardless of what version of Node you, or the users of your libraries are using, use <strong>readable-stream</strong> <em>only</em> and avoid the <em>“stream”</em> module in Node-core.</p>
<p><strong>readable-stream</strong> comes in two major versions, v1.0.x and v1.1.x. The former tracks the Streams2 implementation in Node 0.10, including bug-fixes and minor improvements as they are added. The latter tracks Streams3 as it develops in Node 0.11; we will likely see a v1.2.x branch for Node 0.12.</p>
<p><strong>readable-stream</strong> uses proper patch-level versioning so if you pin to <code>"~1.0.0"</code> you’ll get the latest Node 0.10 Streams2 implementation, including any fixes and minor non-breaking improvements. The patch-level versions of 1.0.x and 1.1.x should mirror the patch-level versions of Node-core releases. You should prefer the <strong>1.0.x</strong> releases for now and when you’re ready to start using Streams3, pin to <code>"~1.1.0"</code></p>
