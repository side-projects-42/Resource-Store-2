**React Live** brings you the ability to render React components with editable source code and live preview. It supports server-side rendering and comes in a tiny bundle.

The library is structured modularly and lets you style and compose its components freely.

Usage
-----

Install it with `npm install react-live` or `yarn add react-live` and try out this piece of JSX:

    import {
      LiveProvider,
      LiveEditor,
      LiveError,
      LivePreview
    } from 'react-live'

    <LiveProvider code="<strong>Hello World!</strong>">
      <LiveEditor />
      <LiveError />
      <LivePreview />
    </LiveProvider>

FAQ

### How does it work?

It takes your code and transpiles it with [Bublé](https://github.com/bublejs/buble), while the code is displayed using [`react-simple-code-editor`](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor) and the code is highlighted using [`prism-react-renderer`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

The transpiled code is then rendered in the preview component (`LivePreview`), which does a fake mount if the code is a React component.

### What code can I use?

The code can be one of the following things:

-   React elements, e.g. `<strong>Hello World!</strong>`
-   React pure functional components, e.g. `() => <strong>Hello World!</strong>`
-   React component classes

If you enable the `noInline` prop on your `LiveProvider`, you’ll be able to write imperative code, and render one of the above things by calling `render`.

### How does the scope work?

The `scope` prop on the `LiveProvider` accepts additional globals. By default it injects `React` only, which means that the user can use it in their code like this:

    //                    ↓↓↓↓↓
    class Example extends React.Component {
      render() {
        return <strong>Hello World!</strong>
      }
    }

But you can of course pass more things to the scope. They will be available as variables in the code. Here’s an example using [styled components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components):

    import styled from 'styled-components';

    const headerProps = { text: 'I\'m styled!' };

    const scope = {styled, headerProps};

    const code = `
      const Header = styled.div\`
        color: palevioletred;
        font-size: 18px;
      \`

      render(<Header>{headerProps.text}</Header>)
    `

    <LiveProvider code={code} scope={scope} noInline={true}>
      <LiveEditor />
      <LiveError />
      <LivePreview />
    </LiveProvider>

Here’s an example using a custom component `<MyButton />`. This component lives in a different directory. It gets passed into the scope wrapped in an Object. Note that since we are not using `render()` in the code snippet we let `noInline` stay equal to the default of `false`:

    import { MyButton } from './components/MyButton';

    const scope = { MyButton };

    const code = `
      <MyButton />
    `

    <LiveProvider code={code} scope={scope}>
      <LiveEditor />
      <LiveError />
      <LivePreview />
    </LiveProvider>

### What bundle size can I expect?

Our reported bundle size badges don’t give you the full picture of the kind of sizes you will get in a production app. The minified bundles we publish *exclude* some dependencies that we depend on.

![](http://img.badgesize.io/https://unpkg.com/react-live/dist/react-live.min.js?compression=gzip&label=gzip%20size)

In an actual app when you use `react-live` you will also be bundling Buble for transpilation, which adds `~135kB` to your bundle. This also includes their dependency on `regenerate-unicode-properties`, which is rather large as well.

We maintain a fork of Buble which excludes the ESnext Regular Expression transpilation with removes Buble’s large dependency and weighs in at a smaller size of `~51kB`, which you can find published at [`@philpl/buble`](http://npm.im/@philpl/buble).

You can alias this in Webpack or the build tool of your choice, which will reduce the overall bundle size of `react-live` to about `83kB`.

### &lt;LiveProvider /&gt;

This component provides the `context` for all the other ones. It also transpiles the user’s code! It supports these props, while passing any others through to the `children`:

<table style="width:99%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Name</th><th>PropType</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>code</td><td>PropTypes.string</td><td>The code that should be rendered, apart from the user’s edits</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>scope</td><td>PropTypes.object</td><td>Accepts custom globals that the <code>code</code> can use</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>noInline</td><td>PropTypes.bool</td><td>Doesn’t evaluate and mount the inline code (Default: <code>false</code>). Note: when using <code>noInline</code> whatever code you write must be a single expression (function, class component or some <code>jsx</code>) that can be returned immediately. If you’d like to render multiple components, use <code>noInline={true}</code></td></tr><tr class="even"><td>transformCode</td><td>PropTypes.func</td><td>Accepts and returns the code to be transpiled, affording an opportunity to first transform it</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>language</td><td>PropTypes.string</td><td>What language you’re writing for correct syntax highlighting. (Default: <code>jsx</code>)</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>disabled</td><td>PropTypes.bool</td><td>Disable editing on the <code>&lt;LiveEditor /&gt;</code> (Default: <code>false</code>)</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>theme</td><td>PropTypes.object</td><td>A <code>prism-react-renderer</code> theme object. See more <a href="https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer#theming">here</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

All subsequent components must be rendered inside a provider, since they communicate using one.

The `noInline` option kicks the Provider into a different mode, where you can write imperative-style code and nothing gets evaluated and mounted automatically. Your example will need to call `render` with valid JSX elements.

### &lt;LiveEditor /&gt;

This component renders the editor that displays the code. It is a wrapper around [`react-simple-code-editor`](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor) and the code highlighted using [`prism-react-renderer`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

<table style="width:99%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Name</th><th>PropType</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>style</td><td>PropTypes.object</td><td>Allows overriding default styles on the <code>LiveEditor</code> component.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### &lt;LiveError /&gt;

This component renders any error that occur while executing the code, or transpiling it. It passes through any props to a `pre`.

> Note: Right now when the component unmounts, when there’s no error to be shown.

### &lt;LivePreview /&gt;

This component renders the actual component that the code generates inside an error boundary.

<table style="width:99%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Name</th><th>PropType</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Component</td><td>PropTypes.node</td><td>Element that wraps the generated code. (Default: <code>div</code>)</td></tr></tbody></table>

### withLive

The `withLive` method creates a higher-order component, that injects the live-editing props provided by `LiveProvider` into a component.

Using this HOC allows you to add new components to react-live, or replace the default ones, with a new desired behavior.

The component wrapped with `withLive` gets injected the following props:

<table style="width:99%;"><colgroup><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /><col style="width: 33%" /></colgroup><thead><tr class="header"><th>Name</th><th>PropType</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>code</td><td>PropTypes.string</td><td>Reflects the code that is passed in as the <code>code</code> prop</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>error</td><td>PropTypes.string</td><td>An error that the code has thrown when it was previewed</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>onError</td><td>PropTypes.func</td><td>A callback that, when called, changes the error to what’s passed as the first argument</td></tr><tr class="even"><td>onChange</td><td>PropTypes.func</td><td>A callback that accepts new code and transpiles it</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td>element</td><td>React.Element</td><td>The result of the transpiled code that is previewed</td></tr></tbody></table>

> Note: The code prop doesn’t reflect the up-to-date code, but the `code` prop, that is passed to the `LiveProvider`.

FAQ

> **I want to use experimental feature x but Bublé doesn’t support it! Can I use babel instead?**

`react-live` doesn’t currently support configuring the transpiler and it ships with Bublé. The current workaround for using some experimental features `bublé` doesn’t support would be to use the `transformCode` prop on `LiveProvider` to transform your code with `babel` alongside `bublé`.

Here is a minimal example on how you could use `babel` to support class-properties in `react-live`:

Comparison to [component-playground](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/component-playground)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are multiple options when it comes to live, editable React component environments. Formidable actually has **two** first class projects to help you out: [`component-playground`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/component-playground) and [`react-live`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live). Let’s briefly look at the libraries, use cases, and factors that might help in deciding which is right for you.

Here’s a high-level decision tree:

-   If you want **fast and easy** setup and integration, then `component-playground` may be the ticket!
-   If you want **a smaller bundle**, **SSR**, and **more flexibility**, then `react-live` is for you!

Here are the various factors at play:

-   **Build**: `component-playground` uses `babel-standalone`, `react-live` uses `bublé`. (*Note*: `react-live` might make transpiler customizable in the future).
-   **Bundle size**: `component-playground` has a larger bundle, but uses a more familiar editor setup. `react-live` is smaller, but more customized editor around `prism`.
-   **Ease vs. flexibility**: `react-live` is more modular/customizable, while `component-playground` is easier/faster to set up.
-   **SSR**: `component-playground` is not server-side renderable, `react-live` is.
-   **Extra features**: `component-playground` supports raw evaluation and pretty-printed output out-of-the-box, while `react-live` does not.
-   **Error handling**: `component-playground` might have more predictable error handling than `react-live` in some cases (due to `react-dom`, although this might change with React 16).
