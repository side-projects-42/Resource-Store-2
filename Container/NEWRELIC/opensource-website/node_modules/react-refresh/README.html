<p>This package implements the wiring necessary to integrate Fast Refresh into bundlers. Fast Refresh is a feature that lets you edit React components in a running application without losing their state. It is similar to an old feature known as “hot reloading”, but Fast Refresh is more reliable and officially supported by React.</p>
