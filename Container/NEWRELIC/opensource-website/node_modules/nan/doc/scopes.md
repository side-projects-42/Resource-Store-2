Scopes
------

A *local handle* is a pointer to an object. All V8 objects are accessed using handles, they are necessary because of the way the V8 garbage collector works.

A handle scope can be thought of as a container for any number of handles. When youâ€™ve finished with your handles, instead of deleting each one individually you can simply delete their scope.

The creation of `HandleScope` objects is different across the supported versions of V8. Therefore, NAN provides its own implementations that can be used safely across these.

-   [**`Nan::EscapableHandleScope`**](#api_nan_escapable_handle_scope)

<span id="api_nan_handle_scope"></span> \#\#\# Nan::HandleScope

A simple wrapper around [`v8::HandleScope`](https://v8docs.nodesource.com/node-8.16/d3/d95/classv8_1_1_handle_scope.html).

Definition:

    class Nan::HandleScope {
     public:
      Nan::HandleScope();
      static int NumberOfHandles();
    };

Allocate a new `Nan::HandleScope` whenever you are creating new V8 JavaScript objects. Note that an implicit `HandleScope` is created for you on JavaScript-accessible methods so you do not need to insert one yourself.

Example:

    // new object is created, it needs a new scope:
    void Pointless() {
      Nan::HandleScope scope;
      v8::Local<v8::Object> obj = Nan::New<v8::Object>();
    }

    // JavaScript-accessible method already has a HandleScope
    NAN_METHOD(Pointless2) {
      v8::Local<v8::Object> obj = Nan::New<v8::Object>();
    }

<span id="api_nan_escapable_handle_scope"></span> \#\#\# Nan::EscapableHandleScope

Similar to [`Nan::HandleScope`](#api_nan_handle_scope) but should be used in cases where a function needs to return a V8 JavaScript type that has been created within it.

Definition:

    class Nan::EscapableHandleScope {
     public:
      Nan::EscapableHandleScope();
      static int NumberOfHandles();
      template<typename T> v8::Local<T> Escape(v8::Local<T> value);
    }

Use `Escape(value)` to return the object.

Example:

    v8::Local<v8::Object> EmptyObj() {
      Nan::EscapableHandleScope scope;
      v8::Local<v8::Object> obj = Nan::New<v8::Object>();
      return scope.Escape(obj);
    }
