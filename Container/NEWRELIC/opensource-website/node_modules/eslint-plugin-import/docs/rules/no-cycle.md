import/no-cycle
===============

Ensures that there is no resolvable path back to this module via its dependencies.

This includes cycles of depth 1 (imported module imports me) to `"∞"` (or `Infinity`), if the [`maxDepth`](#maxdepth) option is not set.

    // dep-b.js
    import './dep-a.js'

    export function b() { /* ... */ }

    // dep-a.js
    import { b } from './dep-b.js' // reported: Dependency cycle detected.

This rule does *not* detect imports that resolve directly to the linted module; for that, see [`no-self-import`](./no-self-import.md).

Rule Details
------------

### Options

By default, this rule only detects cycles for ES6 imports, but see the [`no-unresolved` options](./no-unresolved.md#options) as this rule also supports the same `commonjs` and `amd` flags. However, these flags only impact which import types are *linted*; the import/export infrastructure only registers `import` statements in dependencies, so cycles created by `require` within imported modules may not be detected.

#### `maxDepth`

There is a `maxDepth` option available to prevent full expansion of very deep dependency trees:

    /*eslint import/no-cycle: [2, { maxDepth: 1 }]*/

    // dep-c.js
    import './dep-a.js'

    // dep-b.js
    import './dep-c.js'

    export function b() { /* ... */ }

    // dep-a.js
    import { b } from './dep-b.js' // not reported as the cycle is at depth 2

This is not necessarily recommended, but available as a cost/benefit tradeoff mechanism for reducing total project lint time, if needed.

#### `ignoreExternal`

An `ignoreExternal` option is available to prevent the cycle detection to expand to external modules:

    /*eslint import/no-cycle: [2, { ignoreExternal: true }]*/

    // dep-a.js
    import 'module-b/dep-b.js'

    export function a() { /* ... */ }

    // node_modules/module-b/dep-b.js
    import { a } from './dep-a.js' // not reported as this module is external

Its value is `false` by default, but can be set to `true` for reducing total project lint time, if needed.

When Not To Use It
------------------

This rule is comparatively computationally expensive. If you are pressed for lint time, or don’t think you have an issue with dependency cycles, you may not want this rule enabled.
