import/named
============

Verifies that all named imports are part of the set of named exports in the referenced module.

For `export`, verifies that all named exports exist in the referenced module.

Note: for packages, the plugin will find exported names from [`jsnext:main`](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/jsnext:main), if present in `package.json`. Redux’s npm module includes this key, and thereby is lintable, for example.

A module path that is [ignored](../../README.md#importignore) or not [unambiguously an ES module](https://github.com/bmeck/UnambiguousJavaScriptGrammar) will not be reported when imported. Note that type imports and exports, as used by [Flow](https://flow.org/), are always ignored.

Rule Details
------------

Given:

    // ./foo.js
    export const foo = "I'm so foo"

The following is considered valid:

    // ./bar.js
    import { foo } from './foo'

    // ES7 proposal
    export { foo as bar } from './foo'

    // node_modules without jsnext:main are not analyzed by default
    // (import/ignore setting)
    import { SomeNonsenseThatDoesntExist } from 'react'

…and the following are reported:

    // ./baz.js
    import { notFoo } from './foo'

    // ES7 proposal
    export { notFoo as defNotBar } from './foo'

    // will follow 'jsnext:main', if available
    import { dontCreateStore } from 'redux'

### Settings

[`import/ignore`](../../README.md#importignore) can be provided as a setting to ignore certain modules (node\_modules, CoffeeScript, CSS if using Webpack, etc.).

Given:

    # .eslintrc (YAML)
    ---
    settings:
      import/ignore:
        - node_modules  # included by default, but replaced if explicitly configured
        - *.coffee$     # can't parse CoffeeScript (unless a custom polyglot parser was configured)

and

    # ./whatever.coffee
    exports.whatever = (foo) -> console.log foo

then the following is not reported:

    // ./foo.js

    // can't be analyzed, and ignored, so not reported
    import { notWhatever } from './whatever'

When Not To Use It
------------------

If you are using CommonJS and/or modifying the exported namespace of any module at runtime, you will likely see false positives with this rule.
