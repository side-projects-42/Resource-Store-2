babel-jest
==========

[Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) plugin

Usage
-----

If you are already using `jest-cli`, add `babel-jest` and it will automatically compile JavaScript code using Babel.

    yarn add --dev babel-jest @babel/core

If you would like to write your own preprocessor, uninstall and delete babel-jest and set the [config.transform](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transform-object-string-string) option to your preprocessor.

Setup
-----

*Note: this step is only required if you are using `babel-jest` with additional code preprocessors.*

To explicitly define `babel-jest` as a transformer for your JavaScript code, map *.js* files to the `babel-jest` module. Typescript files are also supported.

    "transform": {
      "\\.[jt]sx?$": "babel-jest"
    },
