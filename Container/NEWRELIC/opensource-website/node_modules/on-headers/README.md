Execute a listener when a response is about to write headers.

Installation
------------

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the [npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the [`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

    $ npm install on-headers

API
---

    var onHeaders = require('on-headers')

### onHeaders(res, listener)

This will add the listener `listener` to fire when headers are emitted for `res`. The listener is passed the `response` object as itâ€™s context (`this`). Headers are considered to be emitted only once, right before they are sent to the client.

When this is called multiple times on the same `res`, the `listener`s are fired in the reverse order they were added.

Examples
--------

    var http = require('http')
    var onHeaders = require('on-headers')

    http
      .createServer(onRequest)
      .listen(3000)

    function addPoweredBy () {
      // set if not set by end of request
      if (!this.getHeader('X-Powered-By')) {
        this.setHeader('X-Powered-By', 'Node.js')
      }
    }

    function onRequest (req, res) {
      onHeaders(res, addPoweredBy)

      res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain')
      res.end('hello!')
    }
