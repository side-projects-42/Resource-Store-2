<p><strong>Do you want to request a <em>feature</em> or report a <em>bug</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the current behavior?</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesnâ€™t have dependencies other than React and react-helmet. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is the expected behavior?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which versions of React and react-helmet, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React and/or react-helmet?</strong></p>
