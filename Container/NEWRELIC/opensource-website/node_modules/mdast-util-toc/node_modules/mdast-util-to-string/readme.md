[**mdast**](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) utility to get the plain text content of a node.

Install
-------

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install):

    npm install mdast-util-to-string

Use
---

    var unified = require('unified')
    var parse = require('remark-parse')
    var toString = require('mdast-util-to-string')

    var tree = unified()
      .use(parse)
      .parse('Some _emphasis_, **importance**, and `code`.')

    console.log(toString(tree)) // => 'Some emphasis, importance, and code.'

API
---

### `toString(node)`

Get the text content of a [node](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast#nodes).

The algorithm checks `value` of `node`, then `alt`, and finally `title`. If no value is found, the algorithm checks the children of `node` and joins them (without spaces or newlines). If the given node is in fact a list of nodes, serializes them.

> This is not a markdown to plain-text library. Use [`strip-markdown`](https://github.com/remarkjs/strip-markdown) for that.

Security
--------

Use of `mdast-util-to-string` does not involve [**hast**](https://github.com/syntax-tree/hast), user content, or change the tree, so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attacks.
