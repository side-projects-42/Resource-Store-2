GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol
===============================

Nomenclature
------------

-   **Socket** is the main WebSocket communication channel between the *server* and the *client*
-   **Connection** is a connection **within the established socket** describing a “connection” through which the operation requests will be communicated

Communication
-------------

The WebSocket sub-protocol for this specification is: `graphql-transport-ws`.

Messages are represented through the JSON structure and are stringified before being sent over the network. They are bidirectional, meaning both the server and the client must conform to the specified message structure.

**All** messages contain the `type` field outlining the action this message describes. Depending on the type, the message can contain two more *optional* fields:

-   `id` used for uniquely identifying server responses and connecting them with the client’s requests
-   `payload` holding the extra “payload” information to go with the specific message type

The server can close the socket (kick the client off) at any time. The close event dispatched by the server is used to describe the fatal error to the client.

The client closes the socket and the connection by dispatching a `1000: Normal Closure` close event to the server indicating a normal closure.

Message types
-------------

### `ConnectionInit`

Direction: **Client -&gt; Server**

Indicates that the client wants to establish a connection within the existing socket. This connection is **not** the actual WebSocket communication channel, but is rather a frame within it asking the server to allow future operation requests.

The server must receive the connection initialisation message within the allowed waiting time specified in the `connectionInitWaitTimeout` parameter during the server setup. If the client does not request a connection within the allowed timeout, the server will close the socket with the event: `4408: Connection initialisation timeout`.

If the server receives more than one `ConnectionInit` message at any given time, the server will close the socket with the event `4429: Too many initialisation requests`.

    interface ConnectionInitMessage {
      type: 'connection_init';
      payload?: Record<string, unknown>;
    }

### `ConnectionAck`

Direction: **Server -&gt; Client**

Expected response to the `ConnectionInit` message from the client acknowledging a successful connection with the server.

The server can use the optional `payload` field to transfer additional details about the connection.

    interface ConnectionAckMessage {
      type: 'connection_ack';
      payload?: Record<string, unknown>;
    }

The client is now **ready** to request subscription operations.

### `Subscribe`

Direction: **Client -&gt; Server**

Requests an operation specified in the message `payload`. This message provides a unique ID field to connect published messages to the operation requested by this message.

If there is already an active subscriber for an operation matching the provided ID, regardless of the operation type, the server must close the socket immediately with the event `4409: Subscriber for <unique-operation-id> already exists`.

    interface SubscribeMessage {
      id: '<unique-operation-id>';
      type: 'subscribe';
      payload: {
        operationName?: string | null;
        query: string;
        variables?: Record<string, unknown> | null;
        extensions?: Record<string, unknown> | null;
      };
    }

Executing operations is allowed **only** after the server has acknowledged the connection through the `ConnectionAck` message, if the connection is not acknowledged, the socket will be closed immediately with the event `4401: Unauthorized`.

### `Next`

Direction: **Server -&gt; Client**

Operation execution result(s) from the source stream created by the binding `Subscribe` message. After all results have been emitted, the `Complete` message will follow indicating stream completion.

    import { ExecutionResult } from 'graphql';

    interface NextMessage {
      id: '<unique-operation-id>';
      type: 'next';
      payload: ExecutionResult;
    }

### `Error`

Direction: **Server -&gt; Client**

Operation execution error(s) triggered by the `Next` message happening before the actual execution, usually due to validation errors.

    import { GraphQLError } from 'graphql';

    interface ErrorMessage {
      id: '<unique-operation-id>';
      type: 'error';
      payload: GraphQLError[];
    }

### `Complete`

Direction: **bidirectional**

-   **Server -&gt; Client** indicates that the requested operation execution has completed. If the server dispatched the `Error` message relative to the original `Subscribe` message, no `Complete` message will be emitted.

-   **Client -&gt; Server** indicates that the client has stopped listening and wants to complete the subscription. No further events, relevant to the original subscription, should be sent through. Even if the client completed a single result operation before it resolved, the result should not be sent through once it does.

    interface CompleteMessage {
      id: '<unique-operation-id>';
      type: 'complete';
    }

### Invalid message

Direction: **bidirectional**

Receiving a message of a type or format which is not specified in this document will result in an **immediate** socket closure with the event `4400: <error-message>`. The `<error-message>` can be vaguely descriptive on why the received message is invalid.

Examples
--------

For the sake of clarity, the following examples demonstrate the communication protocol.

### Successful connection initialisation

1.  *Client* sends a WebSocket handshake request with the sub-protocol: `graphql-transport-ws`
2.  *Server* accepts the handshake and establishes a WebSocket communication channel (which we call “socket”)
3.  *Client* immediately dispatches a `ConnectionInit` message optionally providing a payload as agreed with the server
4.  *Server* validates the connection initialisation request and dispatches a `ConnectionAck` message to the client on successful connection
5.  *Client* has received the acknowledgement message and is now ready to request operation executions

### Connection initialisation timeout

1.  *Client* sends a WebSocket handshake request with the sub-protocol: `graphql-transport-ws`
2.  *Server* accepts the handshake and establishes a WebSocket communication channel (which we call “socket”)
3.  *Client* does not dispatch a `ConnectionInit` message
4.  *Server* waits for the `ConnectionInit` message for the duration specified in the `connectionInitWaitTimeout` parameter
5.  *Server* waiting time has passed
6.  *Server* closes the socket by dispatching the event `4408: Connection initialisation timeout`

### Single result operation

#### `query` and `mutation` operations without streaming directives

*The client and the server has already gone through [successful connection initialisation](#successful-connection-initialisation).*

1.  *Client* generates a unique ID for the following operation
2.  *Client* dispatches the `Subscribe` message with the generated ID through the `id` field and the requested operation passed through the `payload` field  
    *All future communication is linked through this unique ID*
3.  *Server* executes the single result GraphQL operation
4.  *Server* dispatches the result with the `Next` message
5.  *Server* dispatches the `Complete` message indicating that the execution has completed

### Streaming operation

#### `subscription` operation and queries with streaming directives

*The client and the server has already gone through [successful connection initialisation](#successful-connection-initialisation).*

1.  *Client* generates a unique ID for the following operation
2.  *Client* dispatches the `Subscribe` message with the generated ID through the `id` field and the requested operation passed through the `payload` field  
    *All future communication is linked through this unique ID*
3.  *Server* executes the streaming GraphQL operation
4.  *Server* checks if the generated ID is unique across active streaming subscriptions

    -   If **not** unique, the *server* will close the socket with the event `4409: Subscriber for <generated-id> already exists`
    -   If unique, continue…

5.  *Server* dispatches results over time with the `Next` message
6.  -   *Client* stops the subscription by dispatching a `Complete` message
    -   *Server* completes the source stream  
        *or*
    -   *Server* dispatches the `Complete` message indicating that the source stream has completed
    -   *Client* completes the stream observer
