Suggest using `toContain()` (prefer-to-contain)
===============================================

In order to have a better failure message, `toContain()` should be used upon asserting expectations on an array containing an object.

Rule details
------------

This rule triggers a warning if `toBe()`, `toEqual()` or `toStrictEqual()` is used to assert object inclusion in an array

    expect(a.includes(b)).toBe(true);

    expect(a.includes(b)).not.toBe(true);

    expect(a.includes(b)).toBe(false);

### Default configuration

The following patterns are considered warnings:

    expect(a.includes(b)).toBe(true);

    expect(a.includes(b)).not.toBe(true);

    expect(a.includes(b)).toBe(false);

    expect(a.includes(b)).toEqual(true);

    expect(a.includes(b)).toStrictEqual(true);

The following patterns are not considered warnings:

    expect(a).toContain(b);

    expect(a).not.toContain(b);
