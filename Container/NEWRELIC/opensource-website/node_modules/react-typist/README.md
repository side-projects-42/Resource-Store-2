React Typist [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/react-typist.svg)]() [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-typist.svg)]()
=================================================================================================================================

React Component for making typing animations. Wrap `Typist` around your text or any element tree to animate text inside the tree. Easily stylable and highly configurable.

Install
-------

    npm install react-typist --save

Live Example
------------

-   [Basic example](//jstejada.github.io/react-typist)

Basic Usage
-----------

#### CommonJS Module (using webpack or browserify):

    import React, {Component} from 'react';
    import Typist from 'react-typist';

    export default class MyComponent extends Component {

      render() {
        return (
          <Typist>
            Animate this text.
          </Typist>
        );
      }
    }

#### UMD module:

Include `dist/standalone/Typist.js` into your build, using whatever build tool or manually entering a `<script>` tag.

<span id="cssBlink"></span> \#\#\#\# CSS Typist contains a simple CSS file to make the cursor at the end of the text blink. To include it, you must include [`dist/Typist.css`](/dist/Typist.css) in your build.

Children
--------

Typist will animate any text present in its descendents. Each text node will be animated as it is encountered in depth-first traversal of the `children` tree, one after the other.

Typist can take as `children` any valid node that can be rendered in a React application, i.e. it could be undefined, null, a boolean, a number, a string, a React element, or an array of any of those types recursively.

This also implies that you are free to pass any props to the `children` of Typist, including your own css classes (as in any React application). This allows you to easily style your text inside Typist:

    <Typist>
      <span className="my-custom-class"> First Sentence </span>
      <br />
      <div className="container">
        <p> This will be animated after first sentence is complete </p>
        <MyComponent prop1="val1"> More text. </MyComponent>
      </div>
      Final sentence
    </Typist>

Refer to [`examples/`](/examples) for more examples.

Typist.Delay
------------

In order to insert delays into your animation, you can use the `Typist.Delay` Component:

    <Typist>
      <p> First Sentence </p>
      <Typist.Delay ms={500} />
      <br />
      This won't be animated until 500ms after the first sentenced is rendered
    </Typist>

Refer to [`examples/`](/examples) for more examples.

### Typist.Delay Props

-   [`ms`](#ms)

<span id="ms"></span> \#\#\#\# ms *Required*

Milliseconds to apply for the delay

Typist.Backspace
----------------

Typist also supports backspace animations via the `Typist.Backspace` Component:

    <Typist>
      <span> First Sentence </span>
      <Typist.Backspace count={8} delay={200} />
      <span> Phrase </span>
    </Typist>

Refer to [`examples/`](/examples) for more examples.

### Typist.Backspace Props

-   [`count`](#count)
-   [`delay`](#delay)

<span id="count"></span> \#\#\#\# count *Default*: `1`

Number of characters to backspace

<span id="delay"></span> \#\#\#\# delay *Default*: `0`

Delay in milliseconds before the backspace animation starts

Typist Props
------------

-   [`className`](#className)
-   [`avgTypingDelay`](#avgTypingDelay)
-   [`stdTypingDelay`](#stdTypingDelay)
-   [`startDelay`](#startDelay)
-   [`cursor`](#cursor)
-   [`onCharacterTyped`](#onCharacterTyped)
-   [`onLineTyped`](#onLineTyped)
-   [`onTypingDone`](#onTypingDone)
-   [`delayGenerator`](#delayGenerator)

<span id="className"></span> \#\#\#\# className *Default*: `null`

CSS class name to be applied to the Typist root node. Typist will always have the CSS class `Typist` applied to it.

    <Typist className="MyTypist"> Animate this text. </Typist>

will produce:

    <div class="Typist MyTypist"> Animate this text. </div>

<span id="avgTypingDelay"></span> \#\#\#\# avgTypingDelay *Default*: `70`

Average typing delay in milliseconds between every keystroke of the typing animation **(Less is faster)**. The distribution of the typing delays between strokes is not uniform, to make the animation more human like.

<span id="stdTypingDelay"></span> \#\#\#\# stdTypingDelay *Default*: `25`

Standard deviation of typing delay between keystrokes of the typing animation. **(Less means more uniform, i.e. less variance between values)**.

<span id="startDelay"></span> \#\#\#\# startDelay *Default*: `0`

Milliseconds before typing animation begins.

<span id="cursor"></span> \#\#\#\# cursor *Default*:

    {
      show: true,
      blink: true,
      element: '|',
      hideWhenDone: false,
      hideWhenDoneDelay: 1000,
    }

Object containing options for cursor:

-   `show (bool)`: whether to display cursor at the end of text.
-   `blink (bool)`: whether to add blinking animation to cursor. You must also include the [css](#cssBlink)
-   `element (string)`: character to use for the cursor
-   `hideWhenDone (bool)`: whether the cursor should be hidden after tyiping animation is complete.
-   `hideWhenDoneDelay (int)`: delay in ms to be applied before hiding cursor when typing animation is complete.

<span id="onCharacterTyped"></span> \#\#\#\# onCharacterTyped Function to be called every time a character is typed on the screen.

    function(character, charIdx) {
      ...
    }

<span id="onLineTyped"></span> \#\#\#\# onLineTyped Function to be called every time a line is typed on the screen.

    function(line, lineIdx) {
      ...
    }

<span id="onTypingDone"></span> \#\#\#\# onTypingDone Function to be called when typing animation is complete.

<span id="delayGenerator"></span> \#\#\#\# delayGenerator *Default*: [`gaussianDistribution`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)

Function to be called to generate the typing delay (in ms) for every keystroke of the animation. Every time this function is called it should return a value in milliseconds. This function can be used to provide your own typing delay distribution, for example uniform (e.g. always 100ms), or a deterministic distribution.

However, if you wish to insert delays at specific points in the animation, consider useing the [`Delay`](#typistdelay) Component instead.

    function(mean, std, current = {line, lineIdx, character, charIdx, defDelayGenerator}) {
      ...
    }

-   `mean (number)`: Average typing delay. Will be the value of [`props.avgTypingDelay`](#avgTypingDelay)
-   `std (number)`: Standard deviation of typing delay. Will be the value of [`props.stdTypingDelay`](#stdTypingDelay)
-   `current.line (string)`: Value of line of text (Typist child) currently being animated.
-   `current.lineIdx (int)`: Index of line of text (Typist child) currently being animated.
-   `current.character (string)`: Value of character that was just rendered.
-   `current.charIdx (int)`: Index of character that was just rendered.
-   `current.defDelayGenerator (function)`: Reference to default delay generator function to be able to fall back to.

This function can also be used to introduce delays at specific points in the typing animation.

e.g.:

    function(mean, std, {line, lineIdx, charIdx, defDelayGenerator}) {
      // Delay the animation for 2 seconds at the last character of the first line
      if (lineIdx === 0 && charIdx === line.length - 1) {
        return 2000;
      }
      return defDelayGenerator();
    }

Troubleshooting
---------------

### Internet Explorer Compatibility

React Typist makes use of Array.from() which is not supported in IE.

`SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'from' Typist.js (449,1)`

To resolve this, [babel-polyfill](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/) can be added to your project.

    npm install --save babel-polyfill

You can now include this module in your app at the entry point.

ES6:

    import 'babel-polyfill'

CommonJS:

    require('babel-polyfill')

Development

    npm start

Now, open `http://localhost:8080` and start hacking!

If you just want to build the examples, run:

    npm run examples
