Removing unused languages from dynamic import
---------------------------------------------

If a locale is imported dynamically, then all locales from date-fns are loaded by webpack into a bundle (~160kb) or split across the chunks. This prolongs the build process and increases the amount of space taken. However, it is possible to use webpack to trim down languages using [ContextReplacementPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/context-replacement-plugin/).

Let’s assume that we have a single point in which supported locales are present:

`config.js`:

    // `see date-fns/src/locale` for available locales
    export const supportedLocales = ['en-US', 'de', 'pl', 'it']

We could also have a function that formats the date:

    const getLocale = (locale) => import(`date-fns/locale/${locale}/index.js`) // or require() if using CommonJS

    const formatDate = (date, formatStyle, locale) => {
      return format(date, formatStyle, {
        locale: getLocale(locale),
      })
    }

In order to exclude unused languages we can use webpacks [ContextReplacementPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/context-replacement-plugin/).

`webpack.config.js`:

    import webpack from 'webpack'
    import { supportedLocales } from './config.js'

    export default const config = {
      plugins: [
        new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(
          /date\-fns[\/\\]/,
          new RegExp(`[/\\\\\](${supportedLocales.join('|')})[/\\\\\]index\.js$`)
        )
      ]
    }

This results in a language bundle of ~23kb .
