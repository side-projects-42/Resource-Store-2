The final solution for WAI ARIA compatible Modal Dialogs or any full-screen tasks: - locks **focus** inside using [react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock) - disables page **scroll** and user interactions using [react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll) - hides rest of a page from screen-readers using [aria-hidden](https://github.com/theKashey/aria-hidden)

Now you could **focus on** a single task.

> This is basically the `inert`

Example

Code sandbox example - https://codesandbox.io/s/p3vjp8mzw7

    import {FocusOn} from 'react-focus-on';

    <FocusOn
     onClickOutside={callback}
     onEscapeKey={callback}
     shards={[externalRef]}
    >
     content you should be "focused" on
    </FocusOn>

API
===

### FocusOn

`FocusOn` - the focus on component - `enabled` - controls behaviour - `[shards]` - a list of Refs to be considered as a part of the Lock. A way to properly handle portals or scattered lock. — - `[autoFocus=true]` - enables or disables `auto focus` management (see [react-focus-lock documentation](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock)) - `[returnFocus=true]` - enables or disables `return focus` on lock deactivation (see [react-focus-lock documentation](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock)) - `[whiteList=fn]` - you could whitelist locations FocusLock should carry about. Everything outside it will ignore. For example - any modals (see [react-focus-lock documentation](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock)) — - `[gapMode]` - the way removed ScrollBar would be *compensated* - margin(default), or padding. See [scroll-locky documentation](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky#gap-modes) to find the one you need. - `[noIsolation]` - disables aria-hidden isolation - `[inert]` - enables pointer-events isolation (☠️ dangerous, use to disable “parent scrollbars”, refer to [react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll) documentation) - `[allowPinchZoom]` - enables “pinch-n-zoom” behavior. By default it might be prevented, refer to [react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll) documentation — - `[onActivation]` - on activation callback - `[onDeactivation]` - on deactivation callback — - `[onClickOutside]` - on click outside of “focus” area. (actually on any event “outside”) - `[onEscapeKey]` - on Esc key down (and not defaultPrevented)

Additional API
--------------

### Exposed from React-Focus-Lock

-   `AutoFocusInside` - to mark autofocusable element
-   `MoveFocusInside` - to move focus inside a component on mount
-   `InFocusGuard` - to “guard” a shard node (place an invisible node before and after)

See [react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock) documentation for details.

### Exposed from React-Remove-Scroll

-   `classNames.fullWidth` - “100%” width (will not change on scrollbar removal)
-   `classNames.zeroRight` - “0” right (will not change on scrollbar removal)

See [react-remove-scroll](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll) for details.

> PS: Version 1 used React-scroll-locky which was replaced by remove-scroll.
