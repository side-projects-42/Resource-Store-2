Creates a duplex stream

Taken from [event-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream#duplex-writestream-readstream)

duplex (writeStream, readStream)
--------------------------------

Takes a writable stream and a readable stream and makes them appear as a readable writable stream.

It is assumed that the two streams are connected to each other in some way.
