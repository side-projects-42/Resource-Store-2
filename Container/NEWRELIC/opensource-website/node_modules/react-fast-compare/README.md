The fastest deep equal comparison for React. Very quick general-purpose deep comparison, too. Great for `React.memo` and `shouldComponentUpdate`.

This is a fork of the brilliant [fast-deep-equal](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal) with some extra handling for React.

(Check out the [benchmarking details](#benchmarking-this-library).)

Install
-------

    $ yarn add react-fast-compare
    # or
    $ npm install react-fast-compare

Highlights
----------

-   ES5 compatible; works in node.js (0.10+) and browsers (IE9+)
-   deeply compares any value (besides objects with circular references)
-   handles React-specific circular references, like elements
-   checks equality Date and RegExp objects
-   should as fast as [fast-deep-equal](https://github.com/epoberezkin/fast-deep-equal) via a single unified library, and with added guardrails for circular references.
-   small: under 650 bytes minified+gzipped

Usage
-----

    const isEqual = require("react-fast-compare");

    // general usage
    console.log(isEqual({ foo: "bar" }, { foo: "bar" })); // true

    // React.memo
    // only re-render ExpensiveComponent when the props have deeply changed
    const DeepMemoComponent = React.memo(ExpensiveComponent, isEqual);

    // React.Component shouldComponentUpdate
    // only re-render AnotherExpensiveComponent when the props have deeply changed
    class AnotherExpensiveComponent extends React.Component {
      shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {
        return !isEqual(this.props, nextProps);
      }
      render() {
        // ...
      }
    }

Do I Need `React.memo` (or `shouldComponentUpdate`)?
----------------------------------------------------

> What’s faster than a really fast deep comparison? No deep comparison at all.

—This Readme

Deep checks in `React.memo` or a `shouldComponentUpdate` should not be used blindly. First, see if the default [React.memo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) or [PureComponent](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactpurecomponent) will work for you. If it won’t (if you need deep checks), it’s wise to make sure you’ve correctly indentified the bottleneck in your application by [profiling the performance](https://reactjs.org/docs/optimizing-performance.html#profiling-components-with-the-chrome-performance-tab). After you’ve determined that you *do* need deep equality checks and you’ve identified the minimum number of places to apply them, then this library may be for you!

Benchmarking this Library
-------------------------

The absolute values are much less important than the relative differences between packages.

Benchmarking source can be found [here](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/blob/master/benchmark/index.js). Each “operation” consists of running all relevant tests. The React benchmark uses both the generic tests and the react tests; these runs will be slower simply because there are more tests in each operation.

The results below are from a local test on a laptop.

### Generic Data

    react-fast-compare x 157,863 ops/sec ±0.54% (94 runs sampled)
    fast-deep-equal x 149,877 ops/sec ±0.76% (93 runs sampled)
    lodash.isEqual x 33,298 ops/sec ±0.70% (93 runs sampled)
    nano-equal x 144,836 ops/sec ±0.51% (94 runs sampled)
    shallow-equal-fuzzy x 110,192 ops/sec ±0.57% (95 runs sampled)
      fastest: react-fast-compare

`react-fast-compare` and `fast-deep-equal` should be the same speed for these tests; any difference is just noise. `react-fast-compare` won’t be faster than `fast-deep-equal`, because it’s based on it.

### React and Generic Data

    react-fast-compare x 64,102 ops/sec ±0.36% (94 runs sampled)
    fast-deep-equal x 63,844 ops/sec ±0.43% (94 runs sampled)
    lodash.isEqual x 6,243 ops/sec ±0.72% (90 runs sampled)
      fastest: react-fast-compare,fast-deep-equal

Two of these packages cannot handle comparing React elements, because they contain circular reference: `nano-equal` and `shallow-equal-fuzzy`.

### Running Benchmarks

    $ yarn install
    $ yarn run benchmark

Differences between this library and `fast-deep-equal`
------------------------------------------------------

`react-fast-compare` is based on `fast-deep-equal`, with some additions:

-   `react-fast-compare` has `try`/`catch` guardrails for stack overflows from undetected (non-React) circular references.
-   `react-fast-compare` has a *single* unified entry point for all uses. No matter what your target application is, `import equal from 'react-fast-compare'` just works. `fast-deep-equal` has multiple entry points for different use cases.

This version of `react-fast-compare` tracks `fast-deep-equal@3.1.1`.

Bundle Size
-----------

There are a variety of ways to calculate bundle size for JavaScript code. You can see our size test code in the `compress` script in [`package.json`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-fast-compare/blob/master/package.json). [Bundlephobia’s calculation](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-fast-compare) is slightly higher, as they [do not mangle during minification](https://github.com/pastelsky/package-build-stats/blob/v6.1.1/src/getDependencySizeTree.js#L139).
