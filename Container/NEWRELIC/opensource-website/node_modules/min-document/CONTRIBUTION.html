<p>Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.</p>

<p>There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:</p>
<ul>
<li>No –force pushes or modifying the Git history in any way.</li>
<li>Non-master branches ought to be used for ongoing work.</li>
<li>External API changes and significant modifications ought to be subject to an internal pull-request to solicit feedback from other contributors.</li>
<li>Internal pull-requests to solicit feedback are encouraged for any other non-trivial contribution but left to the discretion of the contributor.</li>
<li>For significant changes wait a full 24 hours before merging so that active contributors who are distributed throughout the world have a chance to weigh in.</li>
<li>Contributors should attempt to adhere to the prevailing code-style. Releases</li>
</ul>
<p>Declaring formal releases requires peer review.</p>
<ul>
<li>A reviewer of a pull request should recommend a new version number (patch, minor or major).</li>
<li>Once your change is merged feel free to bump the version as recommended by the reviewer.</li>
<li>A new version number should not be cut without peer review unless done by the project maintainer.</li>
</ul>
