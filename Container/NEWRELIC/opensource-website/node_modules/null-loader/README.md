null-loader
===========

A webpack loader that returns an empty module.

One use for this loader is to silence modules imported by a dependency. Say, for example, your project relies on an ES6 library that imports a polyfill you don’t need, so removing it will cause no loss in functionality.

Getting Started
---------------

To begin, you’ll need to install `null-loader`:

    $ npm install null-loader --save-dev

Then add the loader to your `webpack` config. For example:

    // webpack.config.js
    const path = require('path');

    module.exports = {
      module: {
        rules: [
          {
            // Test for a polyfill (or any file) and it won't be included in your
            // bundle
            test: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/library/polyfill.js'),
            use: 'null-loader',
          },
        ],
      },
    };

And run `webpack` via your preferred method.
