Disallow usage of the implicit `any` type in catch clauses (`no-implicit-any-catch`)
====================================================================================

TypeScript 4.0 added support for adding an explicit `any` or `unknown` type annotation on a catch clause variable.

By default, TypeScript will type a catch clause variable as `any`, so explicitly annotating it as `unknown` can add a lot of safety to your codebase.

The `noImplicitAny` flag in TypeScript does not cover this for backwards compatibility reasons.

Rule Details
------------

This rule requires an explicit type to be declared on a catch clause variable.

The following pattern is considered a warning:

    try {
      // ...
    } catch (e) {
      // ...
    }

The following pattern is ***not*** considered a warning:

    try {
      // ...
    } catch (e: unknown) {
      // ...
    }

Options
-------

The rule accepts an options object with the following properties:

    type Options = {
      // if false, disallow specifying `: any` as the error type as well. See also `no-explicit-any`
      allowExplicitAny: boolean;
    };

    const defaults = {
      allowExplicitAny: false,
    };

### `allowExplicitAny`

The follow is is ***not*** considered a warning with `{ allowExplicitAny: true }`

    try {
      // ...
    } catch (e: any) {
      // ...
    }

When Not To Use It
------------------

If you are not using TypeScript 4.0 (or greater), then you will not be able to use this rule, annotations on catch clauses is not supported.
