react-remove-scroll
===================

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-remove-scroll.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-remove-scroll)

Disables scroll outside of `children` node.

-   üñ± mouse and touch devices friendly
-   üìà vertical and horizontal
-   üìú removes document scroll bar maintaining it space
-   ‚úÖ support nested scrollable elements
-   üï≥ supports react-portals (uses React Event system)
-   ‚ò†Ô∏è it could block literally any scroll anywhere

Usage
=====

Just wrap content, which should be scrollable, and everything else would not.

    import {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll';

    <RemoveScroll>
      Only this content would be scrollable
    </RemoveScroll>  

`RemoveScroll` accept following props - `children` - `[enabled]` - activate or deactivate component behaviour without removing it. - `[allowPinchZoom=false]` - enabled ‚Äúpinch-n-zoom‚Äù behavior. By default it might be prevented. However - pinch and zoom might break ‚Äúscroll isolation‚Äù, and **disabled by default**. - `[noIsolation=false]` - disables outer event capturing. Event capturing is React friendly and unlikely be a problem. But if you are using *shadowbox* of some sort - you dont need it. - `[inert=false]` - ‚ò†Ô∏è(be careful) disables events the rest of page completely using `pointer-events` except the Lock(+shards). React portals not friendly, might lead to production issues. Enable only for **rare** cases, when you have to disable scrollbars somewhere on the page(except body, Lock and shards).  
- `[forwardProps]` - will forward all props to the `children` - `[className]` - className for an internal div - `[removeScrollBar]` - to control scroll bar removal. Set to false, if you prefer to keep it (wheel and touch scroll is still disabled).

Size
====

-   (üß© full) 1.7kb after compression (excluding tslib).
    ---------------------------------------------------

-   (üëÅ UI) **400b**, visual elements only
-   (üöó sidecar) 1.5kb, side effects

    import {sidecar} from "react-remove-scroll";
    import {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll/UI';

    const sidecar = sidecar(() => import('react-remove-scroll/sidecar'));

    <RemoveScroll sideCar={sidecar}>
      Will load logic from a sidecar when needed
    </RemoveScroll>  

> Consider setting `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;` on a document level for a proper mobile experience.

Internal div
------------

But default RemoveScroll will create a div to handle and capture events. You may specify `className` for it, if you need, or **remove it**.

The following code samples will produce the same output

    <RemoveScroll className="scroll">
      Only this content would be scrollable
    </RemoveScroll>

    <RemoveScroll forwardProps>
      <div className="scroll"> //RemoveScroll will inject props to this div
        Only this content would be scrollable
      </div>
    </RemoveScroll> 

Pick the first one if you don‚Äôt need a second.

Position:fixed elements
-----------------------

To properly size these elements please add a special className to them.

    import {RemoveScroll} from 'react-remove-scroll';

    // to make "width: 100%"
    <div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.fullWidth)} />

    // to make "right:0"
    <div className={cx(classWithPositionFixed, RemoveScroll.classNames.zeroRight)} />

See [react-remove-scroll-bar](https://github.com/theKashey/react-remove-scroll-bar) documentation for details.

More than one lock
------------------

When stacked more is active (default) only one (last) component would be active.

Over isolation
--------------

That could happen - you disable scroll on the body, you are suppressing all scroll and wheel events, and you are ghosting the rest of the page by the `inert` prop.

Only something inside Lock does exists for the browser, and that might be less than you expected.

Dont forget about `shard`, dont forget - `inert` is not portals friendly, dont forget - you dont need over isolation in most of the cases.

> just be careful!

Performance
===========

To do the job this library setup *non* passive event listener. Chrome dev tools would complain about it, as a performance no-op.

We have to use synchronous scroll/touch handler, and it may affect scrolling performance.

Consider using `noIsolation` mode, if you have large scrollable areas.

Supported React versions
========================

-   v1 supports React 15/16
-   v2 requires 16.8.0+ (hooks)

Scroll-Locky
============

This is a refactoring of another library - [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky) - to make package smaller and more react-portals friendly.
