      Vendor Specific Utilization Tests
    </h1>
    <p>
      The Utilization tests ensure that the appropriate information is being
      gathered for pricing for a particular cloud vendor. It is centered around
      ensuring that the JSON generated by all agents is correct. Each JSON block
      is a test case, with potentially the following fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>testname</code>: The name of the test.</li>
      <li>
        <code>uri</code>: The API endpoint for the cloud vendor. This contains a
        response indicating what the expected return from the API is for a given
        test.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>expected_vendors_hash</code>: The vendor hash that should be
        generated by the agent based on the uri response.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>expected_metrics</code>: Supportability metrics that are either
        expected or unexpected in a given case. If the
        <code>call_count</code> is 0 it should be asserted that the
        Supportability metric was not sent.
      </li>
    </ul>
