    <h2 id="product-vision">Product Vision</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of the Ruby agent is to provide complete visibility into the
      health of your service. The agent provides metrics about the runtime
      health of your service and the process it runs in, and traces that show
      how specific requests are performing. It also provides information about
      the environment in which it is running, so you can identify issues with
      specific hosts, regions, deployments, and other facets.
    </p>
    <p>
      New Relic is moving toward OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry is a unified
      standard for service instrumentation. You will soon see an updated version
      of the agent that uses the OpenTelemetry SDK and auto-instrumentation as
      its foundation. OpenTelemetry will include a broad set of high-quality
      community-contributed instrumentation and a powerful vendor-neutral API
      for adding your own instrumentation.

    <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
    <p>This roadmap project is broken down into the following sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Now</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            This section contains features that are currently in progress.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Next</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            This section contains work planned within the next three months.
            These features may still be deprioritized and moved to Future.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Future</strong>:
        <ul>
          <li>
            This section is for ideas for future work that is aligned with the
            product vision and possible opportunities for community
            contribution. It contains a list of features that anyone can
            implement. No guarantees can be provided on if or when these
            features will be completed.
          </li>
        </ul>
