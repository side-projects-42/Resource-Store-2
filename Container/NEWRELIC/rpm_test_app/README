== Intro

This is a simple dumb blog app that is meant to be a sandbox for testing
the RPM agent.  It has branches for different versions of rails.  

The master is the generic functionality of the blog app.  Branches periodically
merge the master to keep up to date.  Version specific features like metal
belong on the individual branches.
