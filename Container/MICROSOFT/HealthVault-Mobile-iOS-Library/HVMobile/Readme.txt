- handles application authorization with the Healthvault platform;
- creates and performs custom requests to the HealthVault platform and handles the responses for you;
- provides tombstoning functionality to save all essential parameters between application sessions;
- sample application demonstrates uses of the library including in-browser authorization capabilities.
The library package consists of the following components
1. The library itself (classes\HVMobile).

3. Unit tests (classes\Tests) which cover both the library and demo application.
