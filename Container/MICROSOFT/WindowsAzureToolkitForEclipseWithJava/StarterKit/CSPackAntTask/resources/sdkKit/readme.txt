Because Azure SDK cannot be installed on Linux machines, following files from SDK need to be placed under 'sdkKit' folder which is located inside 'resources' folder:

runtimes\Cloud.uar.csman

runtimes\base\Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.dll

runtimes\base\x64\*

runtimes\base\x86\*

runtimes\storage\cloud\x64\mswacdmi.dll

plugins\RemoteAccess\*

plugins\RemoteForwarder\*
