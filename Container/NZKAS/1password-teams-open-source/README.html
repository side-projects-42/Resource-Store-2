      1Password for Open Source Projects
    </h1>
    <p>
      We rely on open source software every day to develop 1Password. It’s fair
      to say that 1Password wouldn’t exist without the open source community, so
      we want to give back and help teams be more productive and secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you working on an open source project that needs a password manager?
      How about a secure place to keep and share secrets — social media logins,
      code signing certificates, ssh keys, etc? We’ve got your back: get
      1Password Teams free on us.
    </p>
    <h2 id="how-to-apply">How to apply</h2>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Create a team account: https://start.1password.com/signup/?t=B</li>
      <li>
        Invite at least one other person to your team and

    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      To apply, you need to be a project lead or a core contributor for an
      active open source project that is at least 30 days old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your project needs to use a standard open source license and must be
      non-commercial. It should not have paid support or pay contributors. If
      you or your company work on commercial projects, consider
      <a href="https://1password.com/business/">1Password Business</a>. For
      example, AgileBits has several open source projects, but wouldn’t qualify
      for a free team account because it’s a business.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re not sure if your project meets these requirements, please
      contact our support team at opensource@1password.com.
    </p>
    <h2 id="membership-details">Membership details</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>

      <li>
        Team members can use the 1Password apps on all devices — Mac, Windows,
        iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome OS and web.
      </li>
      <li>All app updates are free while your membership is active.</li>
      <li>
        Your membership can be renewed each year if your project still meets the
        requirements. Email us at opensource@1password.com 30 days before your
        membership ends.
