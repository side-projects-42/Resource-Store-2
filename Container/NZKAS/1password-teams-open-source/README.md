# 1Password for Open Source Projects

We rely on open source software every day to develop 1Password. It’s fair to say that 1Password wouldn’t exist without the open source community, so we want to give back and help teams be more productive and secure.

Are you working on an open source project that needs a password manager? How about a secure place to keep and share secrets — social media logins, code signing certificates, ssh keys, etc? We’ve got your back: get 1Password Teams free on us.

## How to apply

1.  Create a team account: https://start.1password.com/signup/?t=B
2.  Invite at least one other person to your team and [add them to the Owners group](https://support.1password.com/groups/#manage-group-membership).
3.  Fork this repo and add an entry to the `Open source projects using 1Password Teams` section at the bottom of this page:

<!-- -->

    ### Project name
    A short description of what we do.
    https://myawesomeproject.org

1.  Create a pull request and fill out the template with the requested details.

## Requirements

To apply, you need to be a project lead or a core contributor for an active open source project that is at least 30 days old.

Your project needs to use a standard open source license and must be non-commercial. It should not have paid support or pay contributors. If you or your company work on commercial projects, consider [1Password Business](https://1password.com/business/). For example, AgileBits has several open source projects, but wouldn’t qualify for a free team account because it’s a business.

If you’re not sure if your project meets these requirements, please contact our support team at opensource@1password.com.

## Membership details

- You’ll receive a renewable year of [1Password Teams](https://1password.com/teams).
- You can invite core contributors to your team account.
- Team members can use the 1Password apps on all devices — Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Linux, Chrome OS and web.
- All app updates are free while your membership is active.
- Your membership can be renewed each year if your project still meets the requirements. Email us at opensource@1password.com 30 days before your membership ends.
- Memberships cannot be transferred or sold.

We’ll review all requests and accept them at our discretion. If accepted, your project may be listed below.
