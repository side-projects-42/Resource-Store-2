The event utility provides browser abstraction for adding DOM2 events. The events themselves are generated by the browser and the browser uses its internal mechanism for notifying the event listeners. When adding multiple events of the same type on a single element, the order the event listeners fire is in the control of the browser. Most browsers fire the listeners in the order that they were registered, but Internet Explorer does not.
