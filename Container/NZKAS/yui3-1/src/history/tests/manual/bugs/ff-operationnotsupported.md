[\[Bug \#2529165\]](http://yuilibrary.com/projects/yui3/ticket/2529165) Firefox: Operation Not Supported
========================================================================================================

You should see an alert saying "it works", whether this page is loaded over HTTP or from a file:// URL.

If you don't see the alert, or if you see an "Operation is not supported" error in the console, this test has failed.
