<h2 id="section">3.4.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>No changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-1">3.4.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>[!] The <code>history-deprecated</code> module, which was deprecated in YUI 3.2.0, has been removed from the library.</p></li>
<li><p>HistoryHTML5 now uses the new <code>window.history.state</code> property (which showed up in Firefox 4 and the HTML5 spec after YUI 3.3.0 was released) to get the current HTML5 history state.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed the <code>enableSessionStorage</code> config option that was previously used to work around the lack of an HTML5 API for getting the current state.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a <code>force</code> config parameter to History constructors. If set to <code>true</code>, a <code>history:change</code> event will be fired whenever the URL changes, even if there is no associated state change.</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: On a page with a <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element, replacing a hash-based history state resulted in a broken URL. [Contributed by Ben Joffe] [Ticket #2530305]</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: In IE6 and IE7, navigating to a page with a hash state could result in endlessly repeating <code>history:change</code> events. [Ticket #2529990]</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: In IE6 and IE7, replacing a history state would actually result in a new history entry being added. [Ticket #2530301]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-2">3.3.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Bug fix: Setting an improperly encoded hash value outside of HistoryHash resulted in two history entries being created. [Ticket #2529399]</p></li>
<li><p>Bug fix: Changes to the URL hash (as opposed to the iframe hash) are now reflected in the history state in IE6 and IE7. [Ticket #2529400]</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="section-3">3.2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>[!] The pre-3.2.0 Browser History Utility has been deprecated, and its module has been renamed to <code>history-deprecated</code>. It will be removed completely in a future release.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial release of the new History Utility.</p></li>
</ul>
