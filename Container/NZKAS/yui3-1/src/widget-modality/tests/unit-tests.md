`Y.Plugin.WidgetModal` Unit Tests
=================================

These unit tests for `Y.Plugin.Modal`cover the general use cases. Namely:

-   Making an overlay modal
-   Nested Modality (modal overlay opening a modal overlay)
-   Various modal widgets (charts & dial)
-   Making sure mask moves around DOM

Currently there's not a great way to test to make sure that the modal widget is receiving focus. For this, refer to the manual test at `modality.html`
