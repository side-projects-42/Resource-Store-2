Panel Manual Tests
==================

The unit tests found at src/panel/tests/unit-tests.html don't do a great job at testing the auto-focus and hide functionality in panel, so this manual test was created to test those.

Create a basic modal panel which focuses when I click outside it, and closes when escape key is pressed

Test content for default panel.

Create a modal panel that hides on click on the mask (test autohide)

Test content for autohide panel.

Create a non-modal panel that hides when an element on the page is clicked

Click me when the panel is up

Test content for node autohide panel.
