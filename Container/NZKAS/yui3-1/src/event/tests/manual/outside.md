Outside Events Testbed
----------------------

Each of the boxes below respond to an outside event by temporarily changing color and displaying the originating event target. Poke around at the page and the test controls to trigger each outside event.

In addition to native DOM events, try triggering Luke Smith's [Konami event](http://yuilibrary.com/gallery/show/event-konami "up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a"). It will only fire once, so refresh the page if you want to try again.
