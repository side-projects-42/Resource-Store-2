<h1 id="handlebars">Handlebars</h1>
<p>Handlebars is a simple template language inspired by Mustache.</p>
<p>This is a YUI port of the original Handlebars project, which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js" class="uri">https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js</a>.</p>
<h2 id="differences">Differences</h2>
<p>YUI-specific changes are minimal. We just wrap the Handlebars code into two YUI modules:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>handlebars-base: The bare minimum code necessary to render pre-parsed Handlebars templates.</p></li>
<li><p>handlebars-compiler: The additional code necessary to parse and compile Handlebars templates.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ‘handlebars’ module is an alias that can be used to load both modules.</p>
<p>Apart from the YUI wrapper code, the only other change is that we use YUI’s own <code>Y.Escape.html()</code> method to escape strings rather than using Handlebars’s built-in escaping. This is done because Handlebars’s built-in HTML escaper avoids double-escaping existing <code>&amp;amp;</code> entities, which can lead to unexpected output, especially when using Handlebars templates to render code snippets in which double-escaping is necessary to properly display the literal text “&amp;”.</p>
<h2 id="code-organization">Code Organization</h2>
<p>The upstream Handlebars code YUI uses is maintained in a fork of the original Handlebars.js project on GitHub, which we’re trying to keep closely in sync with the original Handlebars.js project.</p>
<p>The YUI fork can be found at <a href="https://github.com/rgrove/handlebars.js/tree/yui" class="uri">https://github.com/rgrove/handlebars.js/tree/yui</a>. The “yui” branch on that fork will contain any changes we’ve made that haven’t yet been integrated upstream, but we do our best to get changes integrated upstream as quickly as possible to avoid diverging.</p>
<p>Code from this Handlebars.js repo is imported into the YUI 3 repo by a Makefile in the <code>src/handlebars</code> directory. Running <code>make import</code> will copy Handlebars source files from the separate Handlebars repo into the <code>src/handlebars/js</code> directory in the YUI 3 repo.</p>
<p>Handlebars files imported into <code>src/handlebars/js</code> are prefixed with <code>handlebars-</code> and should not be edited, while YUI-specific files that live in that directory are prefixed with <code>yui-handlebars</code> and may be edited.</p>
<p>After importing Handlebars files, run <code>ant all</code> to build the final YUI modules. The Handlebars API will be available at <code>Y.Handlebars</code> when you use one of the Handlebars modules.</p>
