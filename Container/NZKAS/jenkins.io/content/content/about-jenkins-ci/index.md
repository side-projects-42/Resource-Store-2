Welcome to Jenkins CI, formerly known as "Hudson Labs", a community-driven site for and by the <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci">Jenkins CI</a> community. 

There's more to be said about Jenkins CI, and this site which we'll get to soon!


### Stated Goals

* To help advocate the use of Jenkins CI to the larger internet community
* To be a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Jenkins CI users of all skill-levels
* To recognize the numerous contributors to the Jenkins CI project for their efforts
* Provide community-powered infrastructure for maintaining/developing Jenkins CI

## Site Contributors 

This is by no means a complete listing of all the wonderful Jenkins CI contributors, but these folks are generally responsible for keeping this site online.

Currently the primary editor for the Jenkins CI news site (the successor to "Continuous Blog"), rtyler is not a direct contributor to Hudson via "core" or plugins, he is the "man behind the curtain" for the [@jenkinsci twitter account](http://twitter.com/jenkinsci) and is the founder/moderator of the `#jenkins` channel on the Freenode IRC network. On his personal blog, [unethical blogger](http://unethicalblogger.com), rtyler writes about developing with Python, Jenkins CI and occasionally both at the same time.
