--- :layout: post :title: Jenkins Office Hours, now officially a bi-weekly event :nodeid: 323 :created: 1309198896 :tags: - general :author: kohsuke ---

In May, we launched [Jenkins Office Hours](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours). This was inspired by [Jenkins Ruby hack sessions](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby) by [cowboyd](http://twitter.com/#!/cowboyd), and the idea is to use an interactive online meeting to drive some sub-projects, bootstrap new plugin developers by pointing them to the right extension points, and/or bringing existing community members to discuss some specific key parts of Jenkins and its plugins.

The [first](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/User+Office+Hours+Week+20) [two](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dev+Office+Hours+Week+20) meetings were very popular, but our trial WebEx account expired, and since then we were looking for a sponsor to host this event. And I am happy to report that with a help from Max Spring, now we can get the office hours going again.

So the Jenkins office hours will be bi-weekly events, starting this Wednesday (6/29). [See the wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours) for details and agenda. Looking forward to seeing you!
