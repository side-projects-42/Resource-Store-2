Next two weeks are busy weeks for Jenkins!

The biggest event is of course the world's first ever [Jenkins User Conference](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2011.cb) at San Francisco, Sunday. The event is full now, but the talks will be recorded.

On Monday from 12:30pm (Embarcadero room at Parc 55), Kohsuke will be talking about pre-tested commits in Jenkins (not just for Git but also for Subversion!), as well as the quick recap of the current project status. On the same day in the evening, from 8pm, there will be a community meetup BOF. Andrew and I will be there. Andrew has some slides that he can go over, but it's really up to the attendees to decide what they want us to talk about.

I'll be also at the CloudBees booth in the vendor expo in JavaOne, so if you are around, please drop by and say hello!

After that, I'll be heading to Tokyo, where 14 people will have [the first ever 3-day Jenkins hack camp](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=58000691), complete with a hot spring, the traditional Japanese style. I'll be hosting a short plugin development course there as well.

On that same week, there'll be [another Tokyo user meetup](http://kokucheese.com/event/index/16114/), where all 75 seats have sold out. There'll be announcement about [the first Japanese Jenkins book](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/lino/20110929/1317298261). I'll be also delivering [CloudBees' one-day Jenkins training](http://www.cloudbees.com/training.cb) there as well.

Looking forward to seeing as many of you!
