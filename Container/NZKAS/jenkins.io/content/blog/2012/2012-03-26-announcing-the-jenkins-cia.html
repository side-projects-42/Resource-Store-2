    <p>
      For years, we’ve been hearing about <em>covert</em> installations of
      Jenkins by groups of developers within larger companies. Rogue engineers,
      frustrated by the lack of continuous integration would download
      <code>jenkins.war</code> and run it off their workstation. As time went
      on, word-of-mouth within the organization spread Jenkins far and wide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today we announce an initiative to help support these rogue agents: the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program"
        >Jenkins CIA</a
      >. CIA being short for Continuous Integration Ambassador of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re going to be speaking at a JUG or another event where you will
      have the opportunity to promote and teach people about Jenkins, you too
      can join the CIA:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Send us an email telling us about the event and how many people you
        expect
      </li>
      <li>Write us a guest blog post ahead of time, talking about the event</li>
      <li>
        We dispatch Jenkins stickers and a CIA Agent shirt for you to wear.
      </li>
      <li>Write up a summary blog post about the event afterwards</li>
      <li>Repeat!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In the coming months, we’ll start collaborating and creating standard
      presentations that can be easily re-used to introduce people not only to
      Jenkins, but continuous integration in general, so stay tuned.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re not the speaking type but instead prefer to work behind the
      scenes, you can join the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services"
        >OSS</a
      >
      by checking out the
      <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing"
        >Beginner’s Guide to contributing to Jenkins</a
      >.
