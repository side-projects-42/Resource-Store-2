      It is interesting having an open source project that is sufficiently old
      to start generating “lore” of some form or another. Jenkins is starting to
      get to be that age, having been started over 6 years ago.

      One of the most commonly asked questions, is about Jenkins’ use of “blue
      balls” to indicate success by default. This is enough of an “issue” for
      some users that the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Green+Balls"
        >Green Balls</a
      >
      plugin is in the

        >list of top 10 installed plugins</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason behind our use of blue to indicate success has its basis in
      <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke’s</a> Japanese upbringing.
      The cultural differences were enumerated in a bug report comically titled
      “s/blue/green/g” (<a

      This response Kohsuke cited was taken

        <strong>Q.</strong> “<em
          >Why do Japanese people say that they have blue traffic lights when
          they are really green?</em
        >” –Question submitted by John Sypal
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> According to the book, Japan From A to Z: Mysteries
        of Everyday Life Explained by James and Michiko Vardaman, the first
        traffic signals in Japan were blue instead of green, but the blue lights
        were difficult to see from a long distance away so they were replaced
        with green ones. Vardaman says that the custom of referring to traffic
        lights is a holdover from those days.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sounds like a good explanation, but the problem with it is that you
        will hear Japanese people refer to other green things (like cucumbers,
        spinach, and sometimes grass) as being blue as well. This is because
        historically, Japanese people considered green to be a shade of blue.
        For example, the Chinese character for blue, pronounced ao is made up of
        two characters, iki (life) and i (well) and refers to the colour of
        plants which grow around a well, a colour between green and blue. When
        Chinese people see the character, they say it means green, but Japanese
        people say it means blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Japanese books on colours tell us that there are four tertiary colours:
        red, blue, white and black, and that all others are shades of those four
        main ones. Ao, therefore, is a sort of ideal blue, halfway between green
        and blue. The sky is said to be blue, but it is a different shade of ao
        than a traffic light is. Tree leaves are said to be green, but green is
        a shade of ao, like crimson is a shade of red.
      </p>
      <p>
        In another interesting cultural difference relating to colour, Japanese
        children always colour the sun red instead of yellow.

      Unfortunately it’s not for color blind users, although that’s a pretty
      convincing explanation. Jenkins has blue balls because in Japan, red means
      stop and blue means go!
