      We have hosted two informal meetups introducing Jenkins Continuous
      Integration Server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first in end of June (announced here on this blog) and the second on
      the 7th of August. The first meet-up in June was only announced 8 days
      before, but had very good attendance - the second was completely booked
      (15 seats).
    </p>
    <p>
      The agenda is a short presentation of continuous integration and software
      validation to inspire the use of Jenkins, then a few words and terms about
      Jenkins and finally a live demo. The live demo starts from scratch by
      downloaded the latest Jenkins java web archive, starts it, define a job on
      one of our Maven based java projects on Github. We add two easy plugins
      (Warnings and Task Scanner). Second part of the demo is about unit testing
      and coverage and we show how easy it is to enable a JUnit report and add a
      Cobertura coverage report if there is already unit tests for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meetups have about 90 minutes scheduled, including questions and the
      discussion session after the demo, where we serve pizza, beer and cola.
      The theoretical presentation and live demo is typically finished within
      one hour, even though we encourage our guests to ask questions and discuss
      whatever comes into their mind on the way. The relatively short time used
      for the introduction demonstrates how easy it is to get started with
      continuous integration and software validation using Jenkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the live demo is based on a Java/Maven project we ask the guests about
      their technologies and try to relate that to their setup, so they know
      there also is an easy approach for them to use Jenkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting is quite informal, and limited to 15 participants, leaving
      plenty of time to dicsuss and answer questions both before and after the
      meeting. We are always a few developers from Praqma to facilitate the
      discussions about the participants individual setup and questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      These informal discussions are one of the main gains for us in Praqma, as
      it is very interesting to share our experience with our guests and hear
      about all of their interesting challenges, that might have brough them
      north of Copenhagento attend our meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because these first meet-ups have been so popular and interesting we have
      decided to arrange them regularly in the future. Not just the Jenkins
      introduction, which will be repeated as long as there is an interest, but
      we are also making plans for meetups about Git, Mercurial and other
      topics.
