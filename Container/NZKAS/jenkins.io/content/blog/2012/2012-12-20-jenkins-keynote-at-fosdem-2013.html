      Earlier this year we participated in
      <a href="/event/jenkins-fosdem-2012">FOSDEM 2012</a> in Brussels, Belgium.
      Overall the event was a major success and we’re very happy we were able to
      take part in it!
    </p>
    <p>
      For FOSDEM 2013, we’ll be back in Brussels and participating in a major
      way. The first day of FOSDEM (February 2, 2013) will be the
      <strong>2nd</strong> birthday for the Jenkins project, and seems
      appropriate that project founder
      <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> will be giving
      a <strong>keynote session</strong> titled: “<strong
        ><a
          href="https://fosdem.org/2013/schedule/event/keynote_vibrant_developer_community/"
          >How we made the Jenkins community</a
        ></strong
      >”
    </p>
    <p>Here’s an excerpt from Kohsuke’s talk proposal:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Jenkins project has an interesting history. It started from scratch on
        my spare time, and grow over time to boast 600+ open-source plugins
        developed by 300+ contributors from all around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several key ingredients, both technical and social, that
        enabled this model, and I think those ingredients are useful to other
        projects. In this talk, I’ll discuss how Jenkins project and the
        community works, what these ingredients are, why they help you attract
        more developers into your projects, and why it matters.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

      In addition to the keynote, I (<a href="https://github.com/rtyler"

      communities are hosting the first ever

      If you’re interested in submitting a talk proposal for the dev room the
      deadline is 23:59 UTC on December 21st 2012! The Call for Proposals can be

      We are very likely going to have a table in the hall again this year, but
      the FOSDEM committee hasn’t yet confirmed whether or not we will have a
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless, a <strong>lot</strong> of Jenkins community members will be at
      FOSDEM in February in addition to hundreds of other open source
      contributors and users from around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re interested in participating and/or meeting up with the Jenkins
      crowd, there’s details coming together on

          >the FOSDEM wiki page</a

    </p>
    <p>We hope to see you there!</p>
