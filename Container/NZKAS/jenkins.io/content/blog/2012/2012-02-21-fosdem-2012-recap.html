      This year has already been full of milestones, the first of which being
      our <a href="/content/happy-birthday-jenkins">first birthday</a> as an
      open source project. The second major milestone for the project was that
      we went to <a href="http://www.fosdem.org/2012/">FOSDEM 2012</a>, arguably
      the largest volunteer-organized and operated open source conference on the
      planet.
    </p>
    <p>We had a couple of things going on at FOSDEM that merit a mention:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Jenkins project had a stand in the K building, the same building
        where the Free Java, Config and Systems Management, and a few other
        pertinent dev rooms were located
      </li>
      <li>
        The Jenkins project gave away 2 free copies of
        <a href="https://twitter.com/wakaleo">John Smart’s</a> book: “<a
          href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/jenkins-the-definitive-guide"
          >Jenkins: The Definitive Guide</a
        >” (thanks to O’Reilly!)
      </li>
      <li>
        Community member
        <a href="https://github.com/rtyler/">R. Tyler Croy</a> gave
        <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/2012/02/10/fosdem-slides.html"
          >a talk</a
        >
        on running the Jenkins project infrastructure with
        <a href="http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki">Puppet</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        The O’Reilly folks brought 10+ Jenkins books to sell at their stand.
      </li>
      <li>
        Project founder
        <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> and a
        number of project members held a constructive

        >.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We were very fortunate to have <em>so many</em> Jenkins contributors in
      attendance, who all helped with the Jenkins stand, introducing people to
      Jenkins and much more.

        FOSDEM was for me an opportunity to meet other Jenkins contributors I
        only knew by IRC nickname. Those two days were awesome to discuss with
        users on our stand, joke and socialize, as well as having some more
        technical debates and encourage folks to get involved in the community.
        Even I couldn’t attend the talks I selected on the conference agenda due
        to room being full, I really enjoyed this 100% geek weekend.

        The people, the talks, the social events, the sheer size of FOSDEM all
        make for a pretty inspiring weekend. And incredibly, it’s all for free.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can not help but feel motivated after attending. You always learn
        something new, discover myriad projects – in niches you never knew
        existed – and talk to smart folk from all over.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talking to people at the Jenkins stand was no different. Though in a
        striking number of cases, people <em>had</em> already heard of Jenkins,
        were big fans and took a clutch of stickers back home for their
        colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking with those who weren’t yet using Jenkins was equally<br />
        interesting. My favourite was talking to one guy who described a<br />
        particularly complex workflow; at each step he asked if Jenkins could do
        it, and I was able to cheerily reply “yes” to every single one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting to put faces to names of Jenkins developers was also a huge
        plus, and resulted in numerous great conversations.

        It was great to get some faces to the short names on IRC. Talking to
        other commiters was awesome, I thought they are cool before I went to
        FOSDEM, but now I know!
      </p>
      <p>
        Its was great to talk to people who are using the tools you are working
        on, there where so many just coming up to say thank you! (?and there
        where/are by far more then I thought!) I know I’m standing on the
        shoulders of a giant - but I also do feel that my commitment is of value
        for others too.
      </p>
      <p>Feels great to be part of this community!</p>

        I spent so much time at the stand telling people about Jenkins or
        showing them, that I only ended up seeing a couple actual sessions the
        whole weekend. The kinds of people who came to talk to us almost
        entirely developers of one kind or another, which was really great to
        talk about how Jenkins can be used effectively for Perl shops, for
        Python, C++, C#, Java (of course) or even for deployment automation. The
        spread was a pretty big endorsement, I think, of the extensible nature
        of the Jenkins plugin ecosystem. In planning for FOSDEM I had urged
        Kohsuke to order <em>thousands</em> of stickers for the event, and when
        all was said and done I think we had given away around 1000 stickers to
        new Jenkins fans, old Jenkins fans and a few folks in the community who
        were looking forward to going back to their local JUG to share.

        I’m looking forward to making the trip to the bitter cold of Brussels in
        February again next year.

        FOSDEM had lots of interesting talks and was very well organized (from
        my point of view) and best of all… it’s free! Apart from the talks and
        nice lineup of speakers, it has been a great opportunity to meet people.
        People I already knew, some in person, some only from IRC, the mailing
        list, or as a maintainer of a plugin; but also people thatcame up to the
        Jenkins stand.
      </p>
      <p>From the people that I talked to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          60% knew Jenkins and use it every day (“Yeah, I know Jenkins. The
          whole company uses it and nothing works without it!”)
        </li>
        <li>
          35% had heard of it or were very interested (“I know Jenkins, but we
          bought the Atlassian package and now we have to use Bamboo, Jira and
          Confluence.” [me mentioning the Jira integration of Jenkins] “Wow, I
          really have to try that out and convince our team to switch to
          Jenkins!”.
        </li>
        <li>
          5% Weirdos and WTF!? (<em>disgusted</em> “Is this another one of
          these<br />
          projects funded by Red Hat? They fund everything!”)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Meeting Tom Huybrechts without knowing it (at first) was a big<br />
        suprise. He has created or contributed to some of the best plugins<br />
        (eg. the parameterized-trigger plugin) and I see his name at least<br />
        once whenever I browse through core source code. During the impromptu UI
        enhancement meetings he showed us another three plugins that he wrote
        but never made public just because he doesn’t have time to support them
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then at the stand he casually mentioned that he is administering<br />
        around 3000 jobs on 100+ build machines. At the same time he seems<br />
        like a very humble and low key character.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sum it up, the best thing about an open source project like Jenkins
        is the community. Working together with nice people from all over the
        world to create the best CI server has been a great experience. The
        FOSDEM weekend was another event that proved that. I’ll definitely come
        back.

        FOSDEM is one of the few conferences that has a distinctive hand-made
        geek-for-geek feeling to it. No marketing people, no bullshit flyers,
        but lots of technical folks and good beer. I really enjoyed talking to
        users, as always, but above all I was very happy to see developers and
        project members in the Jenkins community come out in full force, and I
        felt they enjoyed it just as much. I’m really hoping that we’ll now keep
        this going for years to come.

      I think it’s safe to assume we’ll be back next year for
      <strong>FOSDEM 2013</strong>, hope to see you there!
