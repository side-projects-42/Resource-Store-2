Because [the dinner looks popular](http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/84235932/), here's another last minute gathering for [JUC San Francisco](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb).

We'll have a small drink-up Saturday night at [21st Amendment](http://21st-amendment.com/) (563 2nd Street), like from 6pm to whenever. If you are coming from out of town, you probably are around, so why not join us!

At least abayer, majost, and kohsuke should be there, and hopefully more. If you are coming, please leave a comment in this post so that we get the sense of who to expect!
