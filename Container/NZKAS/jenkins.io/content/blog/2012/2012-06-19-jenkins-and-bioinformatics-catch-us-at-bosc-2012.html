      Jenkins will be represented at this years Bioinformatics Open Source
      Conference (<a
        href="http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2012"
        title="BOSC 2012"
        >BOSC 2012</a
      >) on July 13-14th in Long Beach, California. I will be talking about
      Jenkins during my talk about
      <a href="http://www.biouno.org" title="BioUno">BioUno</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      BOSC 2012 will be held just before
      <a href="http://www.iscb.org/ismb2012">ISMB 2012</a>, while registration
      is through ISMB you don’t have to register for ISMB in order to register
      for BOSC.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will be at the event with some Jenkins stickers and available to answer
      questions you might have about BioUno and Jenkins!
    </p>
    <h3 id="about-biouno">About BioUno</h3>
    <p>
      BioUno is a project that uses Jenkins as basis for building
      <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics_workflow_management_systems"
        title="Bioinformatics Workflow Management Systems Wiki entry"
        >biology workflows</a
      >. BioUno provides an alternative update center with custom plug-ins for
      bioinformatics tools like
      <a href="http://mrbayes.sourceforge.net/" title="MrBayes">MrBayes</a>,
      <a href="http://pritch.bsd.uchicago.edu/structure.html" title="Structure"
        >Structure</a
      >,
      <a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/" title="Figtree"
        >Figtree</a
      >, <a href="http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page" title="Beast">Beast</a>,
      among
      <a href="http://www.biouno.org/biouno-plugins/" title="BioUno Plug-ins"
        >others</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the actual task of analysing or displaying data is handled by
      specific tools, that are wrapped by plug-ins, Jenkins is responsible for
      user control, web interface, notifications, distributed execution, job
      schedule and management, as well as other important low level tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      BioUno is similar to
      <a href="http://biohpc.org/" title="BioHPC">BioHPC</a>,
      <a href="http://galaxy.psu.edu/" title="Galaxy">Galaxy</a> and
      <a href="http://www.taverna.org.uk/" title="Taverna">Taverna</a>, in that
      all these tools enable creating and managing pipelines using different
      bioinformatics tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as it is using Jenkins, BioUno has the advantage of having an
      Open Source community of hackers that can answer questions and provide
      assistance for creating new plug-ins. There is plenty documentation for
      <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins"
        title="Extending Jenkins"
        >extending Jenkins</a
      >
      and troubleshooting issues, as well as plenty
      <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins"
        title="Jenkins Plug-ins"
        >existing plug-ins</a
      >
      (that can be used as reference while writing new plug-ins).
    </p>
    <p>
      There are projects and plug-ins that enable Jenkins to use resources in
      clouds or turn Jenkins into a
      <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/" title="Hadoop">Hadoop</a> node, for
      big data processing. The next steps of the project include the deployment
      of BioUno to a computer facility, basic infrastructure for BioUno,
      definition of the process for releasing plug-ins, the creation of more
      plug-ins and a study on how to handle large data structures, used by many
      bioinformatics tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project is being developed by
      <a href="http://www.tupilabs.com" title="TupiLabs">TupiLabs</a> under MIT
      License, and contributions and new plug-ins are welcome.
