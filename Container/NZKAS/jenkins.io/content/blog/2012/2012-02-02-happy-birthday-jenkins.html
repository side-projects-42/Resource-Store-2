      On February 2nd, 2011 the first release of Jenkins, version 1.396, was
      made available for public consumption. Thus marking a new beginning for
      many of us who had come to rely on this very versatile piece of software
      and wanted to see it continue to thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along with some other bug fixes, the 1.396 release of Jenkins included a
      <em>very</em> important changelog item:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em
          >Fixed a trademark bug that caused a considerable fiasco by renaming
          to Jenkins</em
        >
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      On behalf of the core Jenkins team and the governance board I would like
      to extend a extremely large <big><strong>Thank You!</strong></big> to all
      of the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">plugin developers</a>,
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">bug filers</a>,
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org">wiki page editors</a>,
      <a href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/jenkins-the-definitive-guide"
        >book authors</a
      >
      and the users who have helped grow Jenkins into the project it is today.
    </p>
    <p>Some of the tidbits from our highlight reel:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As of this writing there have been <strong>54</strong> releases of
        Jenkins
      </li>
      <li>
        Jenkins now supports
        <a href="/content/beginning-new-era-ruby-plugins-now-reality"
          >writing plugins in Ruby</a
        >
        as well as Java (more languages in the process)
      </li>
      <li>
        We have
        <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/status.html"
          >7 high-speed mirrors</a
        >
        streaming Jenkins packages to users around the world.
      </li>
      <li>There are now over 450 different plugins available for Jenkins</li>
      <li>
        Over 80 donors participated in our
        <a href="/content/fundraising-drive-update-thank-you-everyone"
          >end of year fundraising drive</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        5 “Long Term Support” releases have been published by the Jenkins
        community, offering users a slower moving upgrade target (supported even
        further by CloudBees’
        <a
          href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-enterprise-by-cloudbees-available-plugins.cb"
          >Enterprise Jenkins</a
        >
        product)
      </li>
      <li>
        Public project governance meetings are held and
        <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/">recorded</a> (almost)
        every couple of weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        More than 340 individuals contribute
        <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci">on GitHub</a> to the project in
        some form or another.
      </li>
      <li>
        About 750 members of the
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-dev?lnk="
          >developers mailing list</a
        >
        and around 1700 on the
        <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-users?lnk="
          >users mailing list</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are many other impressive sounding numbers I could rattle off, but
      the list is far too long to be interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The project isn’t perfect and nor is the software, but we’re off to a fine
      start and I hope you’ll join us in making this next year of Jenkins even
      better than the first.
