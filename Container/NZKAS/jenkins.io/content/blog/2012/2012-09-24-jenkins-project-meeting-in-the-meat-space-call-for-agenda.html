      As you may or may not know, the Jenkins project has a
      <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda"
        >bi-weekly IRC meeting</a
      >
      where we discuss and decide on things necessary to keep the project
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next Sunday, we’ll bring this project meeting live to
      <a
        href="http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb"
        >Jenkins User Conference San Francisco</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since this is an unique opportunity to engage people who don’t normally
      come to these meetings, I’d like to encourage everyone to propose agenda
      items and add it to
      <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda#GovernanceMeetingAgenda-JenkinsUserConferenceMeeting@SanFrancisco"
        >the agenda page</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wiki page lists all the past meetings, so you can get a sense of what
      it is like. But this time, we hope to have a good number of users to the
      meeting, not just project insiders. So if you have things you’d like to
      get users feedback on, or if you like project insiders to update you on
      things, please don’t hesitate to add them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still need to work on the logistics, but the plan is to do a cross-over
      with IRC — I’d like to show the IRC client projected in the room, so that
      people in the room can see the conversation in IRC, and I’d like either
      real-time transcribing of voice conversations to IRC and/or live
      broadcasting of the room.
