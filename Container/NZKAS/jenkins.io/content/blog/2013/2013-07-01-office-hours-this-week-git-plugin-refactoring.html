        >Git plugin</a
      >
      is one of the most popular plugins out there, and it’s been around for
      quite some time. Combine that with the fact that there are so many
      different ways to use Git, it was inevitable that Git plugin became quite
      a capable but complex plugin over time. It has more than a dozen options
      and switches, and it was becoming harder to use and harder to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      As early as 2010, some of us have already been saying that we should
      refactor this plugin, but none of us have managed. The good news is, I
      finally started tackling this problem last month while I was in London,
      and I’ve made a steadily progress since then and I’m ready for a wider
      review.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we’ll spend this Wednesday going over the changes. I’ll show you how
      the new version looks, what changes are made internally, and what it’ll
      enable us in the future.

      If the Git plugin is important to you, and you want to see what’s cooking,
      please join us in
