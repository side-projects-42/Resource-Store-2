Your favorite Butler will visit Israel on June 6 for the Jenkins User Conference Israel. More than 200 people have already registered to hobnob with other Jenkins users and eat like kings.

The agenda is up [here](http://jenkins-uc-israel-2013.eventbrite.com/). You’ll find a great list of speakers from Israel, Europe and the US to compliment a plethora of treats. There will be an ice cream break, fruits break, beer break and special chef lunch. And everyone gets a limited-edition JUC Israel t-shirt, designed by the t-shirt-design gurus at JFrog.

Featured speakers:

[Kohsuke Kawaguchi](http://www.cloudbees.com/company-team.cb#KohsukeKawaguchi), the creator of Jenkins (formerly, Hudson) and elite architect at CloudBees, will deliver a keynote about the current state and the future roadmap of Jenkins.

[Hans Dockter](http://www.gradleware.com/team#hans-dockter), the creator of Gradle and the founder of Gradleware will speak about next generation build tool to CI server integration.
