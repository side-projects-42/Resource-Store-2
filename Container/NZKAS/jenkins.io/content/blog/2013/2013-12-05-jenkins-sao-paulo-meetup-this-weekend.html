      I’m going to visit Sao Paulo once again this weekend to attend
      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/133598002/"
        >the second annual Jenkins users meet-up</a
      >. It’s a whole day free event Saturday full of Jenkins goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll hear from a number of active Jenkins folks, and I’ll be presenting
      about what CloudBees (where I currently work) has contributed to the
      Jenkins project, including recent new OSS plugins and some services. I’m
      also stuffing my suitcase with lots of give-aways, including Jenkins
      stickers and
      <a
        href="https://jenkins-ci.org/content/behind-scenes-jenkins-user-conference-palo-alto"
        >popular Jenkins bobble heads</a
      >. I don’t intend to bring anything back to the U.S.
