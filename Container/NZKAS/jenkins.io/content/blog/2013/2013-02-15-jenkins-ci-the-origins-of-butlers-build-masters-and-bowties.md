The folks at [Rebel Labs](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/) picked Jenkins as the last installation of their technical report series. It is a beautifully crafted 50 page PDF that covers the overview of the technology. You get to see a bit of details about how ZeroTurnaround uses Jenkins, and it contains a section where I get interviewed by them.

Also, while they failed to mention this in the document, you can [use JRebel when developing Jenkins plugins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Developing+with+JRebel) and it'll reduce the \# of times you need to restart the VM. To the extent that you use it to develop open-source Jenkins plugins, you can [apply for a free OSS license](http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/buy/), too.

If that sounds interesting enough, you can [get your copy now](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/devs/jenkins-ci-the-origins-of-butlers-build-masters-and-bowties/). Be forewarned that a registration is required.
