The last week the Jenkins project has reached a miletone release â€” [Version 1.500](http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog). That's no 1.5 nor 1.5.0. That's the 501st release since its inception, counting all the way up from 1.0, 1.1 to 1.500.

We'll be celebrating this release in [the upcoming FOSDEM conference](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM) in Brussels, but I wanted to thank everyone for making this great community possible by participating and using it.

Despite [all](http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog-old.html) [the](http://jenkins-ci.org/why) [distances](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda) we've thus far come, there are [still a lot of work](http://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco) to be done, both in the core and plugins, so we look forward to keep on keeping on in the coming years.

So here is to the next 500 release!
