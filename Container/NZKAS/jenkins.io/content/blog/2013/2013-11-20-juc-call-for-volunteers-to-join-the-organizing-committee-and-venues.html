      If you missed JUC Palo Alto on Oct 23, 2013 the

      We are off to planning JUC 2014. It is hard to believe this will be the
      4th annual JUC in the Bay Area. The growth in the Jenkins community since
      the first JUC is astounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every year we are in search of a larger venue to accommodate the larger
      crowd. For 2014, the challenge of finding a venue for a capacity of 500+
      attendees at a low cost will prove even more daunting. We would love to
      hear your suggestions for low cost venues (in the Bay Area) so that we may
      continue to keep entry cost low while providing convenience and the
      highest level of Jenkins education to attendees. Please send suggestion(s)
      to
      <a href="mailto:events@lists.jenkins-ci.org"
        >events@lists.jenkins-ci.org</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We are proud to launch the call for volunteers to join the JUC organizing
      committee (OC). If you are interested in shaping the 4th edition of this
      great event, please send email to
      <a href="mailto:events@lists.jenkins-ci.org"
        >events@lists.jenkins-ci.org</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We encourage you to share this blog within your network in case other
      people would be interested in joining the JUC OC or have ideas for a great
      JUC 2014 location.
