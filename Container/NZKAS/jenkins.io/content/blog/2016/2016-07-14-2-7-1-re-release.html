    <p>
      We created new native packages for Jenkins 2.7.1 today. These replace the
      existing packages. Due to a release process issue, the packaging (RPM,
      etc.) was created the same way as Jenkins 1.x LTS, resulting in problems
      starting Jenkins on some platforms: While we dropped support for AJP in
      Jenkins 2.0, some 1.x packages had it enabled by default, resulting in an
      exception during startup.
    </p>
    <p>
      These new packages for Jenkins 2.7.1, dated July 14, have the same scripts
      and parameters as Jenkins 2.x and should allow starting up Jenkins without
      problems. If you notice any further problems with the packaging, please

      them in the <code>packaging</code> component.
