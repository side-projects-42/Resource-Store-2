After some scrambling earlier in the week to get [1.345 out the door](http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/breaking-hudson-1345-released), correcting some regressions in 1.344, the Hudson team still rolled out a 1.346 release last Friday, February 12th, 2010. Similar to the past couple releases, 1.346 had a good number of bug fixes, including a a performance fix when dealing with larger build submissions and a substantial revision of the SCM polling code to fix a long-standing issue with the quiet period blocking the build from running ([issue 2180](http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2180)), there were also some additionally memory improvements made to <a id="aptureLink_sglHnjrHm5" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20Jelly">Jelly</a>, the library with which the majority of Hudson's web interface is rendered, that Kohsuke will detail in a later post.


Here's the breakdown:


#### Bugs fixed
<ul class=image>
  <li class=bug>
    Maven modules should not be buildable when the parent project is disabled.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-1375">issue 1375</a>)
  <li class=bug>

    Fixed the broken quiet period implementation when polling interval is shorter than
    the quiet period.  (Changes in SCM impls are needed for this to take effect.) 
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2180">issue 2180</a>)
  <li class=bug>
    Escape username in URLs in case it contains special characters such as "#".
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2610">issue 2610</a>)
  <li class=bug>
    Fix sidepanel link for People to be visible and show view-specific info when appropriate.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5443">issue 5443</a>)
  <li class=bug>
    Improved HTML rendering, not using closing tags that do not exist in HTML.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5458">issue 5458</a>)
  <li class=bug>

    Show better error message for missing view type selection when creating a view.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5469">issue 5469</a>)
  <li class=bug>
    Hudson wasn't properly streaming a large external build submission,
    which can result in OOME and unresponsiveness.
</ul>
