Last Friday the Hudson team rolled out a small 1.372 with two enhancements following the **critical** [1.371 release on Monday](http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/big-security-fix-hudson-1371-released). Not a whole lot to say about this release other than go get it!

#### Enhancements

- Persist matrix-based security settings in a consistent order ([issue 7138](http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-7138))
- Jobs can now use boolean expression over labels to control where they run.

You can go grab the [latest .war file](http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/hudson/war/1.372/hudson.war) straight from our [OSL mirror](http://www.osuosl.org) or if youâ€™re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.
