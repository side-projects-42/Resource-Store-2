      A couple weeks ago in the
      <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-1347-released"
        >post outlining the release of Hudson 1.347</a
      >
      I mentioned that Alan Harder (a.k.a. mindless) had undertaken a
      deprecation-crusade; that is to say Alan has taken it upon himself to rid
      Hudson’s code-base, particularly in the plugin area, of older code. One of
      Alan’s branches <code>old-data-monitor</code> was merged into trunk with
      <code>r28147</code> bringing with it some changes to help migrate older
      plugin datasets to newer formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I reached out to Alan earlier today on IRC (<code>#hudson</code> on
      the
      <a id="aptureLink_C8savgu6dL" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode"
        >Freenode</a
      >) about the subject he agreed that polling the community for beta testers
      would be a good idea; <strong>this is where <em>you</em> come in</strong>.
      Per Alan’s message to the <code>dev@</code> mailing list:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Visit your “Manage Hudson” screen to see if the notice about
        old/unreadable data appears. I’ll be curious to see which of the old
        deprecated data structures are actually out there in people’s XML files.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Instead of waiting for the release candidate to be packaged Wednesday
      evening, I’ve gone ahead and published the artifact from
      <a href="http://hudson.glassfish.org/view/Hudson/job/hudson-trunk/4544"
        >build #4544</a
      >
      which can be downloaded here:
      <a
        href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_build4544.war"
        >hudson.war</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have an <strong>old</strong> Hudson installation with, testing this
      build would be incredibly useful. Alan went on to say:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        If people find issues with OldDataMonitor, they should file them at
        <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">issues.hudson-ci.org</a> in “core”
        component and assign them to “mindless”.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This change does not mutate any data (or at least it shouldn’t) so it
      should be safe, be on the look out for exceptions in Hudson’s log on
      startup.
