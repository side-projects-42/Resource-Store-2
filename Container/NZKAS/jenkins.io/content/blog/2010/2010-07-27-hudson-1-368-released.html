    <p>
      Regular readers will recognize that I’ve been slacking off quite a bit
      lately with my release announcements, my apologies. With the release of
      1.368 on Sunday, which fixed a few fairly important bugs, I figured I’d
      dusty off my blogging fedora and give this a shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      This release has three bug fixes in it which were causing some issues for
      some users, particularly those deploying Hudson inside the recently
      released
      <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html"
        >Tomcat 7.0</a
      >
      (see
      <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6738">issue 6738</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudson users utilizing the
      <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Tool+Auto-Installation"
        >JDK auto-installation</a
      >
      feature between different platforms may have been affected by
      <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-6880">issue 6880</a>
      which was also fixed in this release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bringing up the rear is the fix to
      <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-7004">issue 7004</a>
      which detailed a few discrepencies between the
      <code>/buildWithParameters</code> and the <code>/build</code> remote APIs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re not affected by these issues, you may want to wait for the
      soon-to-be-released 1.369 which has <strong>even more</strong> juicy bug
      fixes in it (with a dash of enhancements) to upgrade.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can go grab the
      <a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/hudson/war/1.368/hudson.war"
        >latest .war file</a
      >
      straight from our <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSL mirror</a> or if
      you’re using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.
