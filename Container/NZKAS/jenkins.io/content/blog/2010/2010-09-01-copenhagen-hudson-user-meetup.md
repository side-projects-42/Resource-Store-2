![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Kopenhagen_Innenstadt.JPG/280px-Kopenhagen_Innenstadt.JPG)September is turning into a meetup month for the Hudson community. In parallel to [the meetup in Oslo](http://hudson-labs.org/content/hudson-javazone-meetup-oslo) and [the meetup in JavaOne](http://hudson-labs.org/content/pre-javaone-hudson-meetup), [Nokia](http://www.nokia.com/) and [InfraDNA](http://infradna.com/) are hosting a meetup in Copenhagen on September 6th, Monday. Read on for the details.

The current tentative plan is to do a short "state of the union / what's new" kind of presentation, then use the rest of the time for open mic Q&A, but if you have other ideas, or better yet if you want to do some talks, please let me know. I think the event will be fun.

If you plan on coming, please [drop me a note](mailto:event@infradna.com), so that we can get some sense of the attendance.

- **When:** September 6th, 18:30
