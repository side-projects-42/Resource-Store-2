      A few weeks ago I passed a job listing that I had found through one of my
      <strong>many</strong> Google Alerts for Hudson-related queries to Andrew
      (<code>abayer</code>), following up on one of those job listings Andrew
      recently signed an offer to join the nice folks over at Digg to be their
      resident “build guy.” On its own I thought “great for Andrew!” and nothing
      more, then I saw
      <a
        href="http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bi58m/anyone_here_a_build_engineer_or_part_of_the_build/"
        >this thread</a
      >
      on reddit which poses the question:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Anyone here a build engineer, or part of the build team? Could you
        please share your experience?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It seems, to me at least, the notion of “release engineering” is making a
      come-back, particularly in the aging “Web 2.0” world where companies like
      Digg, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc are anywhere from five to ten years
      old. As these companies have aged a couple of important things have
      happened, their code-base has aged increasing the possibility of bitrot,
      but they have also expanded in terms of headcount. Start-ups that might
      have once slighted larger corporations like Oracle, Cisco VMWare and IBM
      for their burdensome process and longer release schedules now find
      themselves ensnared with massive code bases, larger development teams and
      complicated deployments.

      Over the past few months we’ve seen Hudson being used in a number of
      different contexts, it was
      <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-pycon"

      >
      as part of a larger appeal to the Python community to get on the
      continuous integration bandwagon, we’ve seen a few posts from developers
      using Hudson for testing and packaging

      used, it is no longer the mainstay of the Java shop’s toolkit, it’s become
      a must have for <em>all</em> developers.

      With the allure of

      and Hudson’s lowered barrier to entry for testing, packaging and
      automating releases, is release engineering making a comeback?
