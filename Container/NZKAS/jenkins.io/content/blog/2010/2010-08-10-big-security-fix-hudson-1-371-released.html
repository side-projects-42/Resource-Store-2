      Hot on the heels of Hudson 1.370, which was released last Friday, the
      Hudson team released 1.371 which addresses a
      <strong>critical vulnerability</strong> in <strong>all</strong> Hudson
      versions prior to 1.371. The vulnerability was disclosed by
      <a href="http://infradna.com">InfraDNA</a> in the
      <a href="http://infradna.com/content/security-advisory-2010-08-09"
        >following security advisory</a
      >, which details the issue:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        This critical vulnerability allows an attacker to use CLI commands that
        they are otherwise unauthorized for. CLI commands can perform various
        administrative operations.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is advised that <strong>all</strong> Hudson instances be upgraded
      immediately to avoid data loss or other ill effects from this issue. If
      you’re upgrading from a version earlier than 1.370, you can consult the
      <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> for details on the other bug fixes and
      enhancements covered by the upgrade of your version to 1.371.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you run a Hudson instance, it is recommended that Hudson system admins
      subscribe to either the
      <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hudson-security-advisories"
        >security advisories RSS feed</a
      >
