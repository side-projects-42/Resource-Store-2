      As The Build Doctor and his readers point out, continuous integration is a
      difficult task to offload into the cloud because of the immense hardware
      demands constant building and testing presents. That said, Hudson
      <em>does</em> very effectively manage spinning slaves up and down on
      demand if you’ve configured it as such. Implication being: running Hudson
      in the cloud may be more efficient to meet peak demands without needing to
      run a large farm of machines.<img
