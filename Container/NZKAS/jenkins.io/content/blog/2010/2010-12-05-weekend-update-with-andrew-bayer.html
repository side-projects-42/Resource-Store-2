      I wanted to give the Hudson community a quick update on the current status
      of the issues Tyler has
      <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing"
        >discussed in the earlier posts</a
      >
      here.

      Friday afternoon, <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>,
      <a href="http://www.cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> CEO
      <a href="https://twitter.com/SachaLabourey">Sacha Labourey</a> and myself
      jumped on a conference call with Hudson contributor/Oracle employee
      <a href="http://twitter.com/wjprakash">Winston Prakash</a>, Oracle manager
      Denis Tyrell and of course Ted Farrell.
    </p>
    <p>
      We discussed a wide range of issues relating to the Hudson project, such
      as governance, the rights to the name Hudson, and the infrastructure
      hosting the Hudson project. While we didn’t agree on resolutions to all
      issues, I feel real progress was made towards a framework that provides
      what the Hudson community needs while also preventing the sort of
      conflicts we’ve seen the last week or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      More work has to be done - we’ll be talking again next week, and I’m
      hoping we can reach agreement on the contentious issues by the end of the
      week.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for your patience.</p>
