      Last night on my way out of San Francisco I stopped by 4th and Howard St
      to get my first taste of JavaOne/Oracle OpenWorld which was already taking
      shape at the location. Besides snapping the photo below, I also managed to
      get yelled out by an old woman wearing a red “security” jacket; suffice to
      say my JavaOne experience is already everything I expected!

      Unlike last year’s Oracle OpenWorld, which also shut down this segment of
      Howard St in San Francisco and took over the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens,
      this event will be crammed together with JavaOne.

    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I’m not sure what I can expect as far as the JavaOne portion
      of the event goes, we do have <strong>two</strong> Hudson related events
      scheduled:
    </p>
    <!--break-->
    <p><br clear="all" /></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Getting More Out of Your Hudson</strong> - Monday at 10:00 a.m.
        - Hosted by our very own
        <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>, the
        session will be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Embarcadero.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Getting More from Your CI Server: Taking Hudson to the Next
          Level</strong
        >
        - Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. - Hosted by the (in)famous
        <a href="http://twitter.com/wakeleo">John Smart</a> the session will
        also be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Cyril Magnin 1.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br clear="all" /></p>

    </p>

      Unfortunately those were the only specifically-Hudson related tracks I
      could find, as <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer">Andrew Bayer</a> has
      <a href="http://twitter.com/abayer/status/24507253586">mentioned before</a
      >, finding a proper schedule is near impossible. While at JavaOne, I
      intend on posting updates, pictures and maybe a little scathing commentary
      (they did give me a blogger pass for some silly reason).

    <p>
      If you’re going to be at JavaOne,
      <a
        href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/lets-talk-about-hudson-javaone"
        >think about coming and talking to me</a
      >
      about how you/your company uses Hudson. I might just have stickers!
