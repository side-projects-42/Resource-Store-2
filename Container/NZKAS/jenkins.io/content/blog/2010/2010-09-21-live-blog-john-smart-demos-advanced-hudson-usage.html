      John takes the stage at 9:30, this presentation is
      <em>totally</em> different from yesterday’s presentation from Kohsuke
    </p>
    <p>Taking Hudson a little further, beyond just scheduling a build job.</p>
    <p>Who is <strong>not</strong> using Hudson, less than 10% raise hands.</p>
    <p>
      Focusing on the more technical/nitty-gritty things with Hudson. Looking
      at:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>CI Basics</li>
      <li>Notification strategies</li>
      <li>Quality metrics</li>
      <li>Build promotions</li>
      <li>
        Automated deployment
        <!--break-->
        Who knows what build promotions? Who uses build promotions? Very few in
        the audience use build promotions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Who uses Hudson for automated deployment, a handful raise their hands.
      Plenty of Tomcat and JBOSS users automating deployment. John going to use
      Tomcat for the automated deployment demo in this presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      John mentions he’s authoring the “Continuous Integration with Hudson”
      book, which will be available for download as it comes out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s talk about Continuous Integration! Summing up what CI is in three
      words: <strong>feedback, visibility</strong> and
      <strong>delivery</strong>. CI is about <em>snappy feedback</em>. You want
      feedback in <strong>minutes</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visibility should be associated with continuous integration, getting
      everybody in the product life cycle into the loop with continuous
      integration (product people, QA, developers, etc).
    </p>
    <p><strong>What makes Hudson so great?</strong> (according to John)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>
        Plenty of plugins/the ecosystem around Hudson for extending/integrating
        Hudson
      </li>
      <li>Reporting/coverage features</li>
      <li>Distributed builds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      First demo, the Hudson dashboard (starring the Nested View plugin).
      Starting with a basic dashboard filled with some unstable and stable
      builds. Cloudy builds thanks to Cobertura coverage grading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using the Nested View plugin to group views to make the dashboard more
      useflu for a <strong>ton</strong> of jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Covering build radiators, not enough of the audience uses radiators. John
      advocates commandeering big monitors for radiators as part of your
      “notification strategy”
    </p>
    <p>
      Covering the basic version control integration, John
      <strong>highly</strong> recommneds using a “Repository Browser”. “The
      point is, you want one” John starts improvising with making some changes,
      pops over to Eclipse and refactors some code, commits and kicks off a
      build. Navigates to the source changes for the newly broken build in
      “Sventon”, his repository browser of choice which was connected to the job
    </p>
    <p>
      John shows the job using Maven integration and deploying artifacts to the
      Maven repository he’s set up on his local machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudson will automatically keep track of jar files/war files, so enable the
      “Discard Old Builds” checkbox to prevent Hudson from eating all kinds of
      disk space. Useful to only discard the artifacts for the last X builds
      instead of the test results/code coverage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Desktop build notifiers are quite useful, email can tend to get
      clutter/lost in the mess with everything else coming into your inbox.
    </p>
    <h4 id="test-results-integration">Test results integration</h4>
    <p>
      Going into the test results dashboard per-build and the test-result and
      build time trends for a specific job.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why is the build time trend useful? If the build suddenly takes a
      <em>huge</em> amount of time to run, you’ve likely got performance issues
      that need fixing.
    </p>
    <h4 id="publishing-html-reports">Publishing HTML reports</h4>
    <p>
      Starring the HTML Publisher plugin! Using the plugin to publish HTML
      reports generated from easyb for publishing acceptance test results for
      more wide-spread consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bouncing from HTML reports to integrating with Sonar for code quality
      metrics
    </p>
    <h4 id="build-promotion">Build Promotion</h4>
    <p>
      Starring the Promoted Builds plugin! Covering some similar concepts to
      Kohsuke’s talk yesterday but literally going into the Hudson configuration
      and setting it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time is running out, John’s flipping back and forth between the M2 release
      plugin and his automatic deployment to his local Tomcat environment.
    </p>
    <h4 id="qa">Q&amp;A</h4>
    <p>
      “Can Hudson be used for other environments”. Yes! Supports a number of
      build plugins, MSBuild, NAnt, CMake, in addition to the freestyle build.
      “Maven 3 support” Sonatype is apparently working on an integrated version
      of Hudson with Maven 3, Hudson core planning support “eventually.”
