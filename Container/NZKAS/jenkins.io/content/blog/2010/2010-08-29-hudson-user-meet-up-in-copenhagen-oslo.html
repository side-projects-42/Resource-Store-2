    <p>
      I’ll be in Copenhagen from 9/5-9/7 and in Oslo 9/8-9/9 to present in
      JavaZone. I’d like to take advantage of the opportunities and have user
      meet-up events in those cities. Depending on the number of participants,
      it could be just a drink in a bar, or a talk in a meeting room.
    </p>
    <p>So if you are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>in those cities,</li>
      <li>available in the evening of 9/6, 9/8, or 9/9, and</li>
      <li>willing to attend such an event,</li>
    </ol>
    <p>… then please <a href="mailto:kohsuke@infradna.com">let me know.</a></p>
    <p>
      Also, if you have an office in those cities and willing to provide a space
      for an event, that would be extra appreciated!
    </p>
