      It’s been a little over a month since I pinged Kohsuke about an “official
      Hudson blog”; my role has been nothing more than writer and editor of a
      community resource, while I have invested a lot of time in Continuous Blog
      it is not “mine” so much as it is “ours.” I feel I have a responsibility
      as the current maintainer of this resource to be as open as possible about
      what’s going on with CB. When I sat down to write the inaugural post,
      <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/welcome-continuous-blog"
        >Welcome to Continuous Blog</a
      >, I set forth a few goals:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Help advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community
        </li>
        <li>
          Be a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson
          users of all skill-levels
        </li>
        <li>
          Recognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their
          efforts
        </li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Being a community resource, I wanted to review our progress on those goals
      along with some other interesting details about Continuous Blog and my
      community efforts. My metrics for achieving these goals are largely based
      on web traffic to this blog and retweets via the
      <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci"
        ><span class="citation" data-cites="hudsonci">@hudsonci</span></a
      >
      twitter account. First a minor overview of some of Continuous Blog’s
      traffic, then I’ll get to reviewing the goals.

      <em>Visitor trend via Google Analytics</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past month Continuous Blog has seen just under 10,000 visits from
      a number of different sources, the top sources being:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a> links posted to
        <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci"
          ><span class="citation" data-cites="hudsonci">@hudsonci</span></a
        >
      </li>
      <li>Direct visits</li>
      <li><a href="http://feedburner.google.com/">Feedburner</a></li>
      <li>
        Referrals from the “blog” link on
        <a href="http://hudson-ci.org">hudson-ci.org</a>
      </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/domain/hudson-ci.org">reddit</a></li>
      <li>
        Links from the <a href="http://java.net">Java.net</a> community portal
        and associated weblogs
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition to general web traffic, Continuous Blog has around 350 RSS
      subscribers.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put these numbers into perspective, Hudson has seen commits from 173
      different developers and the
      <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci"
        ><span class="citation" data-cites="hudsonci">@hudsonci</span></a

      twitter account has about 1,100 followers.

      ### Hudson Advocacy Looking at the traffic sources and the volume of
      traffic coming from what I would consider “the wider internet community”
      I’d say I failed to meet my own expectations. The majority of traffic
      seems to be coming from “within the community”, which is certainly not a
      bad thing by a stretch, but I was hoping to start to see more visitors who
      are less likely to be using Hudson already. There are signs of this (I
      think) in the low number of search referrals, roughly 370 visits. To me
      this indicates the early age of this site, small number of external links
      to Continuous Blog and the content isn’t “interesting” enough to come up
      in searches for terms like “continuous integration with python”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vector for improvement in advocacy, in my opinion, is to focus more on
      tutorials and user guides in the next month. Mike Rooney’s post on
      <a
        href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/keeping-your-configuration-and-data-subversion"
        >Keeping your configuration and data in Subversion</a
      >
      was both discussion provoking, but one of the more visited pages over the
      past month. I’ll be reaching out to more power-users from differing
      backgrounds to try to get some more tutorials on using Hudson for Python,
      Ruby, and Cocoa development while continuing to bug some of you Maven2
      pros about guides.
    </p>
    <h3 id="central-information-repository">Central information repository</h3>
    <p>
      I feel I failed to meet my own expectations here as well, it has only been
      a month (feels like an eternity!) so the amount of information we’ve been
      able to aggregate is small, but growing.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have likely spent too much time covering Hudson community news, which I
      feel is important, to put a human voice in front of commits and releases,
      but it is not what I originally intended to spend the majority of my time
      doing.
    </p>
    <h3 id="recognition-of-contributors">Recognition of contributors</h3>
    <p>
      In my opinion, this goal I’ve met. When writing up each Hudson release
      I’ve made certain to give credit where credit is due, to those that
      contributed, Through the “spotlight” series of posts I’ve also made an
      effort to highlight power-users of Hudson, trying to glean interesting
      details about their installations from them for our benefit. Unfortunately
      I’ve done a poor job highlighting the contributions from individual plugin
      developers, something I’m still not certain how to correct.
    </p>

    <h3 id="content">Content</h3>
    <p>
      If you’ve been following the blog you have no doubt noticed the regular
      occurrence of certain types of posts, these regular series are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        “This Week in Plugins”
        <ul>
          <li>
            This post is halfway script generated, pulling all the release
            details out of SVN history to help me generate a post. The intention
            of the post being to cite new or notable plugins, while giving an
            informative listing of “what’s happening” in plugin development for
            the past week.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        “Spotlight On”
        <ul>
          <li>
            The only interview-formatted series I’ve got going right now, I’ve
            been trying to find companies or organizations who are using Hudson
            in interesting ways and are willing to let “us” peek behind the
            curtains a bit. This started more from curiosity, but I think it’s
            fun to let Hudson users brag about their set ups.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Hudson 1.xxx Released
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pretty straight-forward reporting on a release of Hudson, depending
            on the contents of the release there may be some calls to action or
            editorializing on what’s gone into the release.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Links for
        <ul>
          <li>
            Roll-up of links shared or retweeted via the
            <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci"
              ><span class="citation" data-cites="hudsonci">@hudsonci</span></a
            >
            account, uncertain whether this is worth the time spent.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>My two questions to the community in general would be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do you dislike any of these?</li>
      <li>What else would you like to see on a regular basis?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I’m certainly open to suggestion, I’d like Continuous Blog to continue to
      be interesting to the Hudson community and if certain kinds of posts are
      boring or uninteresting, I can cut them from the line-up.
    </p>
    <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      The largest challenge of Continuous Blog is <strong>time</strong>. As it
      stands the majority of content I write or edit in some capacity, which is
      a larger amount of time than I expected to spend. All said and done it
      takes me between 6-10 hours a week to write for CB, keep tabs on
      <a id="aptureLink_ExoR9hi6I6" href="http://twitter.com/hudsonci"
        ><span class="citation" data-cites="hudsonci">@hudsonci</span></a
      >
      and peruse the mailing list for interesting things. This probably isn’t
      maintainable, and if for some reason a bus hits me (<a
        href="http://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=muni+hits+pedestrian"
        >not uncommon around here</a
      >), this blog would go dark for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be easily fixed by simply adding more contributors to the blog,
      I’ll post more on how to write for Continuous Blog in another post.

      All said and done, I am looking forward to another month of writing and
      following the Hudson community. I’m grateful for all those who’ve asked
      questions, been interviewed, wrote content and participated in discussion
      in the comments. For those of you in the Bay Area, I do hope you come out
      for the
      <a
        href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co"
        >meet-up in mid-March</a
      >, for the rest of you, I’ll catch you on IRC :)
