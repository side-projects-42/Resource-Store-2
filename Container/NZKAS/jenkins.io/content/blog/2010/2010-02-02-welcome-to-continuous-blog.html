      Hello and welcome to “Continuous Blog”, the official Hudson weblog! If you
      don’t mind me saying so, I think its arrival is long overdue. Since Hudson
      started in November of 2006, there hasn’t been a central “voice” for the
      project. In just a few short years Hudson has grown into a substantial
      project with <strong>hundreds</strong> of plugins and thousands of users
      around the world. <a href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a>’s
      nice Java-based extensible continuous integration server has grown up into
      fantastic tool with a great community around it.
    </p>
    <h3 id="goals-for-this-weblog">Goals for this weblog</h3>
    <p>
      I think it is important to set out a couple of goals for this weblog, some
      simple items that should help guide the content and discussion around
      Continuous Blog and its future.
    </p>
    <p>Continuous Blog should:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community</li>
      <li>
        Be a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson
        users of all skill-levels
      </li>
      <li>
        Recognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their
        efforts
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h3>
    <p>
      As Continuous Blog grows and matures, you can expect to see a variety of
      Hudson-related content. Overviews of the latest releases of Hudson and its
      plugins, interviews and discussions with the developers who have
      contributed to Hudson over the years, guest posts by power-users on how
      Hudson fits into their workflow and much much more (really).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you look around the page you’ll already see a good amount of content,
      in the sidebar to the right you’ll notice the “Recently Released” section
      which aggregates recently released plugins via
      <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectRSS?type=news"
        >this RSS feed</a
      >
      , the “Blogs” section which is an aggregation of Hudson community blogs
      (from
      <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/KohsukesHudsonBlogs">this RSS feed</a
      >).
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re just starting out so make sure you
      <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/ContinuousBlog"
        >subscribe to the RSS feed</a
      >, we’ve got a lot to talk about here on Continuous Blog.
