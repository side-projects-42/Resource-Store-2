Recently our fearless leader, Kohsuke Kawaguchi, was invited by the nice folks over at Digg to give a [tech talk about continuous integration](http://about.digg.com/blog/digg-technical-talks-kohsuke-kawaguchi) and automated testing. The Digg engineering team is full of believers in continuous integration, including our very own Andrew Bayer (`abayer`). Being big users of the <a id="aptureLink_mtfp40hfVE" href="http://twitter.com/saucelabs">Sauce Labs</a> service to drive their vast Selenium test suite, the house was packed with Selenium hackers/users and Hudson users, the stage was set for Kohsuke to give a great presentation.

For those not familiar with Digg's peripheral involvement in the Hudson community, they've graciously donated a build machine to help run Hudson builds on [ci.hudson-labs.org](http://ci.hudson-labs.org/).
