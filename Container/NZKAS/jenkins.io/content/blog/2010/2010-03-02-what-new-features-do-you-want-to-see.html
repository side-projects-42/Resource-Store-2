      Michael Donohue, a Hudson developer who has taken on the role of master
      bug triage guy for Hudson, does something regularly which I’ve really come
      to appreciate as a Hudson developer myself: he sends out emails to the dev
      list with the top 10 voted issues at that time. This gives those of us in
      the Hudson development community a good sense of what’s really important
      to our users, which in turn helps us decide where to focus our efforts. If
      you’re interested, you can see
      <a
        href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10045"
        >the top voted issues</a
      >
      over at <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">our JIRA server.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A good number of those issues have been high on the list for a while - I’m
      actually in the early stages of work on a plugin to answer
      <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-682">HUDSON-682</a>,
      the current #1 most voted-for issue, two and a half years after it was
      opened. But I’m sure there are some equally useful features Hudson users
      would like to see added which aren’t on that list. So I’m asking you, dear
      readers: what are you looking for in Hudson that isn’t already there? Take
      a look around the existing issues - you may find a request that fits what
      you want lurking just out of the top 10, needing only your vote to push it
      into the spotlight. If no one’s yet created an issue requesting your
      desired feature, well, create one.
    </p>
    <p>Or, better still, write a plugin or contribute a patch yourself!</p>

      early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson’s core and a
