      Yesterday Digg was kind enough to host and “sponsor” (read: free drinks
      and pizza!) a Hudson meetup at their offices in San Francisco. While Digg
      has been the source of some controversy and press due to their recent
      redesign and corporate shake-ups, as far as the Hudson community goes
      they’ve been largely responsible for a

      Attendees included all of InfraDNA (Kohsuke and Kedar), some folks from
      CloudBees, a number of local users/developers like
      <a href="http://twitter.com/LewisHam">LewisHam</a> and myself, and to top
      off the list a couple Oracle employees including
      <a href="http://twitter.com/wjprakash">Winston Prakash</a> who is now
      hacking on Hudson inside of Oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As folks started arriving there was a lot of discussion around “Hudson at
      Scale”, specifically regarding Hudson “in the cloud”. We also got to hear
      about one of the most interesting Hudson use-cases I’ve ever seen by
      <a href="http://edwardmgoldberg.com">Edward M. Goldberg</a> who I’ll post
      an interview with shortly, imagine using Hudson with
      <strong>thousands</strong> of machines, it’s that interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the afternoon there were a number of great discussions concerning
      Hudson stability, engaging more of the community and nitty-gritty details
      regarding Hudson’s internals such as the plugin API.
    </p>

      I’ve posted

      on Flickr for posterity in case you’re interested. Overall I’d judge the
      meetup to be a success, it was a lot of fun and a great way to spend a
      Sunday with Hudson.

      If you’re going to be at JavaOne, come track me down and let’s talk about
      Hudson, if you’re not in San Francisco for the event, you can always
