      Ever wanted to pick the brains of <strong>multiple</strong> Hudson
      developers and users, all at the same time? Feel like finally meeting
      Kohsuke in person? Now’s your chance!
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re hosting our
      <a
        href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0"
        >second-ever Bay Area Hudson Hackathon/Meetup</a
      >
      on <strong>March 19th and 20th</strong>. That’s nearly <em>two</em> whole
      days of Hudson!
    </p>
    <h3 id="day-one-mar.-19">Day One (Mar. 19)</h3>
    <p>
      The first day of the hackathon/meetup is aimed primarily at those working
      with Hudson’s core, or are building on top of Hudson (plugins, etc).
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Start:</em> 10 a.m.</li>
      <li><em>End:</em> 5 p.m.</li>
      <li>
        <em>Location:</em>
        <a href="http://tinyurl.com/SunSantaClaraCampus"
          >Oracle Santa Clara campus</a
        >
        in the “library” conference room of SCA7 “Mansion” building.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There will a number of community and corporate Hudson hackers joining us
      on Friday, so bring everything you’ll need to get some grade A hacking
      done with Kohsuke, Andrew Bayer, Alan Harder and your fellow plugin
      hackers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="day-two-mar.-20">Day Two (Mar. 20)</h3>
    <p>
      I’m tentatively calling this the <strong>main event</strong>, which will
      be hosted at the delightful
      <a href="http://hackerdojo.pbworks.com">Hacker Dojo</a> in Mountain View.
      The “main event” will carry over the hackathon from the day before at
      Oracle, into a full blown community hackathon and meet-up. This is for
      Hudson <strong>hackers and users</strong> alike!
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Start:</em> 10 a.m.</li>
      <li><em>End:</em> 6 p.m.</li>
      <li>
        <em>Location:</em>
        <a href="http://hackerdojo.pbworks.com/">Hacker Dojo</a> (Savanna room)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As I’ve
      <a href="http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/hudson-pycon"
        >pointed out before</a
      >, Hudson’s getting a lot of attention in other developer circles such as
      the Python, Ruby, Cocoa communities. As such, I’m hoping to get a lot of
      folks interested in using Hudson to come to Hacker Dojo where we (already
      being Hudson users) can help get them up to speed with all the great
      things Hudson can do.

      ### How you can help While I casually refer to myself as a “PR intern” for
      <a id="aptureLink_8uglegfosn" href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa"
        >Kohsuke</a
      >, I’m technically a busy software engineer, meaning I’m grateful for all
      the help I can get.
    </p>
    <h5 id="get-the-word-out">Get the word out</h5>
    <p>
      The best way to help get the word out is to talk about Hudson and the
      meetup, this includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link to this post on Twitter</li>
      <li>Ping any user groups you are a member of in the area</li>
      <li>Blog about it</li>
      <li>Let your co-workers know about it</li>
      <li>Attend!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <br clear="all" />
      ##### Volunteer to help setup/teardown Hosting the Saturday event at
      Hacker Dojo does carry some responsibilities with it. We will need some
      extra hands to make sure everybody has power, refreshments are chilled,
      lunch is ordered and delivered, and of course, cleaning up after we leave.
      If you’re in a generous mood, or in a real need for some karma, sign up to
      help on
      <a
        href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0"
        >the bottom of the wiki page</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I am hoping Oracle and some other heavy users/contributors will kick in a
      few bucks for lunch and drinks on Saturday, if you think your company can
      help us out, feel free to ping me directly at <code>tyler</code> at
      <code>linux.com</code>.
