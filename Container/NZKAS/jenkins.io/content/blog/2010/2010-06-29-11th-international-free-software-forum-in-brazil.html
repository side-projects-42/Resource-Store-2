      >
      regarding his upcoming talk on continuous integration and Hudson:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Next month I will present

          href="http://verdi.softwarelivre.org/papers_ng/activity/view?activity_id=44"
          >a talk about Hudson</a
        >
        in the 11th International Free Software Forum (<a
          href="http://softwarelivre.org/fisl11"
          >FISL 11</a
        >), held in Porto Alegre Brazil (detailed time and date of the talk are
        not yet scheduled so).
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      FISL 11 is one of the biggest free software events in Latin America and
      will quite literally attract <em>thousands</em> of free software users,
      hackers, and enthusiasts. It will be held from the 21st to the 24th of
      July in Porto Alegre, if youâ€™re in Central or South America, you should
      <em>definitely</em> try to attend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leandro will have Hudson stickers on hand to give out and will surely do a
      fantastic job presenting Hudson to all those future Hudson users, I hope
      you can make it!
