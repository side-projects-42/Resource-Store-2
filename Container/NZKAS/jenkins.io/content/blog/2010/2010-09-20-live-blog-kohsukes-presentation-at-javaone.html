      Kohsuke takes the stage, asks “who uses’s Hudson” the majority of audience
      raises their hands
    </p>
    <p>
      Discussing the great ecosystem using Hudson across the wide-variety of
      platforms/languages. 330+ community written plugins. Last year at JavaOne
      we had 230+ plugins
    </p>
    <p>Eclipse Community Survey, Hudson adoption from 9.1% in 2009 to 21.8%</p>
    <p>
      Discussing Hudson adoption, going over Hudson job postings on indeed.com
      going up compared to a stagnant Cruise Control.
    </p>
    <p>Kohsuke introduces himself and InfraDNA, started Hudson in 2004/2005.</p>
    <p>
      First steps to CI, 10,000 foot overview of SCM monitoring/build/testing.
      Delving into using Hudson for automating <strong>everything</strong> to
      get "more out of your Hudson deployment.
    </p>
    <h3 id="interconnecting-jobs-aka-workflows">
      “Interconnecting Jobs aka Workflows”
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hudson allows for hosting many projects on one Hudson deployment, meaning
      you need a smaller number of administrators for a larger number of jobs
      compared to Cruise Control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building Block #1: Triggering. Using “upstream” and “downstream” jobs ot
      interconnect jobs to form a workflow in Hudosn. Triggering is asynchronoys
      in Hudson, useful for separating builds and multiple test jobs. Splitting
      the build and test jobs so you build quickly test many tests in parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Avoid recompiling compilation/builds in the “downstream” test runs. “Copy
      Artifact” plugin very useful for passing built executables to test jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstream/downstream separation also highly useful for separating build and
      deployment into a continuous workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building Block #2: Join plugin. Fan downstream jobs out and then bring
      everything back together for final steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shows Join plugin configuration screen because “perhaps the configuration
      is a little unintuitive”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Building block #3: Fingerprints. Using MD5 checksums from artifacts to
      learn more about those artifacts in your Hudson, tying together artifacts
      from different jobs/builds. Letting Hudson recording these fingerprints of
      those artifacts in your lifecycle allows Hudson to help you find out
      where/when those executables came from.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fingerprinting mechanism good for tracking dependencies from third
      parties, Hudson uses 3rd party fingerprints to compute additional
      information. Also useful for aggregating reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going a bit further using the “build promotion plugin” to weed out which
      builds are “better than others.” Taking fingerprints from a build job all
      the way through the life cycle and passing that fingerprint around
      test/smoke test jobs, if that passes, build passes on to more rigorous
      testing, only if it’s passed base-level testing. Basic model of promotion
      maps to a “confidence level”, 1st level passes compilation, 2nd level
      passes smoke test, 3rd level passes expensive/time-consuming tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the reasons to use promotion in your lifecycle to ensure that
      artifacts meet a minimum “confidence level” so you’re not expending
      resources running the longer tests )think about a promotion hierarchy)
    </p>
    <p><strong>Demo time!</strong></p>
    <p>
      Kohsuke demoing build promotion live with fingerprinting of sample jar
      files. Creating a “component-X” build and a “test-X” build. test-X job
      using the “Copy Artifact” plugin to grab artifacts from the component-X
      build.
    </p>
    <p>
      Defining the promotion criteria in “component-X”, “test-X” promoted,
      indicates that certain builds promoted a build.
    </p>
    <p><strong>End demo time!</strong></p>
    <h3 id="maven-integration">Maven Integration</h3>
    <p>
      Maven integration highlights. Going over POM comprehension and simplified
      configuration due to more information getting inferred from the POMs.
      Building dependency chains with Maven integration.
    </p>
    <p>“That’s the basics, let’s talk about advanced integration with Maven”</p>
    <p>
      Parallel-module builds! Letting Hudson builds modules with a single
      checkbox, meaning wherever possible Hudson will try to build your modules
      in parallel when possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Incremental builds! Only building changed modules in a build run to be
      more efficient, preventing the need to rebuild the whole project from
      scratch every time. Hudson’s SCM integration to determine what the mapping
      between files changed and modules needing to be built.
    </p>
    <p>
      Private Maven repositories! Avoiding artifacts being overwritten by
      others, telling Hudson to create a Maven repository
      <strong>per-project</strong> (at the expense of more bandwidth/disk space
      needed), helps segregate builds to avoid them stomping on each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      After-the-fact deployment, avoiding deploying modules unless the whole
      build is successful (all modules properly built). Instead of using
      <code>mvn deploy</code>, you tell Hudson to deploy to your Maven
      repository with a single checkbox.
    </p>
    <h3 id="matrix-project">Matrix Project</h3>
    <p>No longer alpha! Production-ready!</p>
    <p>
      Often used to build/test across slight variations of build environments
      such as different platforms for a C++ project. Conceptually it’s like
      running your build in a for loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudson supports a number of different axes, most popular of which being a
      “slave axis” which allows you to use different labels or specific slaves
      for the build. Hudson also supports arbirtrary text fields as axes to be
      passed along to the build steps as environment variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Touching on “filtering” in the matrix project support to remove parts of
      an axis that you do not need. I.e if you have a “platform” and a “browser”
      axes for web testing, you can exclude the “iexplore” value of the
      “browser” axis when the “platform” axis is “mac”.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Demo time!</strong></p>
    <p>
      Defining two axes, “slave” axis and the “JDK” axis to build against
      different JDK versions on linux, solaris and windows. Excluding
      “touchstone builds” to avoid rebuilding a large number of matrix builds
      unless a limited subset of the combinations successfully build. Used to
      avoid spending a lot of time spinning cycles on very obvious errors that
      the first few builds “recognize” immediately.
    </p>
    <p><strong>End demo time</strong></p>
    <h3 id="doing-selenium-testing-on-hudson">
      Doing Selenium testing on Hudson
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use “Selenium Grid plugin” to install Selenium binaries on all slaves and
      prepares them all to talk to each other. Useful for “overloading” an
      existing Hudson cluster as a Selenium cluster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using labels in Hudson to better determine which node has which browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Selenium integration is <strong>very</strong> powerful when combined with
      the join plugin and the matrix configuration support in Hudson for web
      testing across a large number of platforms and browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hudson project has invested heavily in getting great cluster support
      which helps tremendously with Selenium which has invested as heavily in
      clustering.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to you deal with Selenium needing a GUI while Hudson slaves are
      largely headless. Use the Xvnc plugin! On Windows things are bit trickier,
      easier to let Hudson slave/service “interact with desktop” such that it
      can access dialogs/etc. Failing everything else, configuring Windows for
      auto-login and then have JNLP slaves autostart at login will work for
      allowing the slave to use the GUI and network resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the session was dedicated to some good Q&amp;A. Great session
      by Hudson’s founder.
