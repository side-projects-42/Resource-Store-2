      A few months ago I enjoyed running a couple
      <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/views/interviews"
        >interviews with folks</a
      >
      who were using Hudson but lately I’ve lacked the time and coffee to get
      more interviews done.
      <img

        alt="Interview time!"
        align="right"
        hspace="10"
      />
    </p>
    <p>
      I am planning on making up for it by bringing my fancy smancy tape
      recorder (i.e. a smartphone) and a few notepads to the upcoming
      <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/javaonedevelop/index.html"
        >JavaOne conference</a
      >
      here in San Francisco.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re interested in talking to me about how you or your company uses
      Hudson in your quest for world domination, you will be able to find me at
      the
      <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/pre-javaone-hudson-meetup"
        >Hudson hackathon</a
      >
      on Sunday the 19th, or at JavaOne on Monday, Tuesday and
      <em>maybe</em> Wednesday.

      up!
