      Rarely do I ever get mail, let alone mail I like, so I was quite excited
      when a shipment of stickers from
      <a href="http://tinyurl.com/SunSantaClaraCampus">Hudson HQ</a> arrived
      yesterday. I’m certain you’re thinking to yourself “what does this guy
      need hundreds of Hudson stickers for?” Fact is, I don’t! They’re not for
      me, they’re for you!
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>I am willing to mail stickers vast distances to you</strong> (<em
        >with some conditions</em
      >)
    </p>

      #### Conferences If you’re presenting at a conference or otherwise would
      like some Hudson stickers to go around, email me with a rough estimate of
      how many you need. The only condition being that you tell me all about the
      event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an
      interview).
    </p>
    <h4 id="user-groups">User Groups</h4>
    <p>
      If you email me requesting some stickers for a user group, I’ll need an
      estimate of how many folks attend meetings. Depending on supplies, I may
      send you a little more than requested to be shared.
    </p>
    <h4 id="companies">Companies</h4>
    <p>
      If your company wants some Hudson stickers, I’d be happy to oblige, and of
      course I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see:
      <a
        id="aptureLink_R5zxZUYv2n"
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional%20item"
        >swag</a
      >) in return!
    </p>
    <h4 id="people-who-like-stickers">People who like stickers</h4>
    <p>
      If you’re just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I’ll still gladly mail
      you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the
      stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me
      some cool pictures or post them to
      <a
        id="aptureLink_S4ASBrm3CN"
        href="http://www.crunchbase.com/company/flickr"

      I will be stuffing envelopes in my free time, so there may be a slight
      delay. You can email me at <code>tyler</code> at <code>linux</code> dot
      <code>com</code> requesting stickers, I’ll need:
