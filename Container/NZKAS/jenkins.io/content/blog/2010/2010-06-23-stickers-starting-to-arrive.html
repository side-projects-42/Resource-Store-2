      Way back in March, I asked you all:
      <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/want-some-hudson-stickers"
        >Want some Hudson stickers?</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Turns out, a <strong>lot</strong> of you do! Thanks to a huge amuont of
      help by
      <a
        href="http://agentdero.cachefly.net/erinandtylerswedding.com/images/gallery/mq/img-9.jpg"
        >my future wife</a
      >, the <em>first</em> shipment of Hudson stickers went into the mail last
      week.
      <img

        align="right"
        hspace="5"
        vspace="5"
      />
      This first shipment was only to United States addresses! If you live
      outside of the U.S., or if you requested more than 50-ish stickers, I’ve
      not yet been able to send you stickers. I expect to start sending out
      international shipments later this week and early next week.

      To those of you that have received your stickers, I’d like to remind you
      of the terms of our agreement:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Conferences</strong>: The only condition being that you tell me
        all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may
        involve an interview).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Companies</strong>: I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded
        bouncy balls, etc (see: swag) in return!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Nice People</strong>: If you’re just a fan of Hudson, stickers,
        or both, I’ll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition
        that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your
        Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to
        Flickr (tagged: “hudsonstickers”)
      </li>
    </ul>

      To be honest, I <em>really</em> just want to see some pictures of Hudson
      stickers slapped all over cool stuff: laptops, bosses, servers, desks,
      stop signs, coworkers, cats, you name it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>If you did not request stickers, but want some now:</strong>
      please refer to the
      <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/want-some-hudson-stickers"
        >original post</a
      >
      for directions. I do still have stickers left, but there are some “bulk
      requests” I’ve not yet filled. I will do my best to send out as many
      stickers as I can.
