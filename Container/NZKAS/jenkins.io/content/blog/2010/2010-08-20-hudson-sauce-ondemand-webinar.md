On September 1st, I’ll be [presenting in a Sauce Labs webinar about Hudson and Sauce OnDemand](http://saucelabs.com/about/webinars#webinar-hudson). The talk will discuss how Hudson can be used with Sauce OnDemand, naturally, but it’ll also cover broader Hudson/Selenium integrations.

Please [register to this free event](https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/789261128), and looking forward to seeing to you virtually.
