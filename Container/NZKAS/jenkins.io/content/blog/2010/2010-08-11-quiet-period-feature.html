      Commits often come in a burst. This seems to happen mainly for two reasons
      — people sometimes forget to commit some files, and in the tranquility of
      waiting for your SCM to finish a commit, people sometimes realize the
      problems in the commit and they quickly make follow-up changes. The
      conventional wisdom is that the CI server should wait for the burst to
      finish before attempting a build. This is said to reduce the chance of
      having broken build, and it is also sometimes useful in reducing the
      average turn-around time for builds that take longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, Hudson is capable of waiting for a commit burst to be over before
      it triggers a new build, and this feature is called “quiet period.” There
      are two parts in Hudson that interacts with the quiet period. One is the
      SCM polling behavior and the other is the queue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queue portion of the quiet period is straight-forward. When a build is
      scheduled into the queue with quiet period, the build will sit in the
      queue until the quiet period expires. If during this period, additional
      attempts are made to put the same build in the queue, the quiet period
      resets to its initial value. For example, if the quiet period is 5
      minutes, and the build is put into the queue 9:00am and 9:03am, the actual
      build will only happen after 9:08am. Thus another way to think of the
      quiet period is that you are requiring a certain period of inactivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above applies to all the mechanisms in Hudson that puts builds into
      the queue. This includes REST API call, CLI call, downstream triggers, and
      SCM pollings. So if you implement some kind of a “push” mechanism in your
      SCM to notify Hudson of a new commit, then you get the desired effect by
      just setting the quiet period in Hudson, and those push scripts don’t have
      to do anything tricky.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible for some of those to override the quiet period
      configured in the project. For example, when you click “Build Now” button
      in your browser, your browser is making a REST API call, but with the
      quiet period of zero. I used to run a “push” script that looks into a
      commit message and overrides the quiet period by taking advantages of this
      feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other portion of the quiet period that often matters is the SCM
      polling behaviour. Up until Hudson 1.346, the way Hudson defined the SCM
      abstraction made it impossible for SCMs to correctly report newly detected
      commits since the last polling. Instead, it was only possible to report if
      the repository is newer than the workspace. As a result, if the polling
      interval is set shorter than the quiet period, the build stayed in the
      quiet period forever. This was tracked in HUDSON-2180.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hudson 1.346 fixed this issue, and so if you are using a newer version of
      Hudson and SCM plugins that take advantage of this improvement, then
      everything works as expected. Otherwise, avoid setting quiet period longer
      than the polling interval.
