      Last Friday the Hudson team released release <strong>1.363</strong> which
      is yet another mixed bag of enhancements and bug fixes. Along with the
      usual bunch of fixes, this release includes a number of localization
      updates courtesy of a team of Hudson community volunteers participating in
      the Hudson
      <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Internationalization"
        >Internationalization project</a
      >.
    </p>

      It is also worth noting that this post is being published on Tuesday,
      contrary to the schedule that I operated on with Continuous Blog, I will
      no longer be posting release updates on Monday morning. Traditionally
      Hudson is released Friday afternoon (PST), meaning any potential
      regressions are reported early on Monday morning after our European users
      start to upgrade. Publishing this release announcement on Tuesday gives me
      more time to test out the release so I can report with greater confidence
      in the reliability of the update. (<em>Note</em>: This may change in the
      future as we push for easier RC testing capabilities within Hudson)

      If you’re a regular reader of the Hudson Labs blog, you may also notice
      that this change log looks eerily similar to the
      <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/hudson-1362-released"
        >1.362 announcement</a
      >
      from last week. Turns out I had mistakenly taken the upcoming changes from
      1.363 and reported them as fixes in 1.362; I’ve since updated the post
      regarding 1.362’s change log.
