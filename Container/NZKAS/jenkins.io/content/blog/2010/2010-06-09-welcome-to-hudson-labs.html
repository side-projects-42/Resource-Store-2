      Hello again! It’s been a long time since I’ve written for the Hudson
      community, but now I’m back and ready to tackle some of the latest
      developments in the Hudson community.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-is-hudson-labs">What is Hudson Labs?</h3>
    <p>
      As you may have
      <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/kohsuke-leaves-sun"
        >read in April</a
      >, Kohsuke left Oracle to found
      <a href="http://www.infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a>, a company specializing
      around Hudson. The departure meant the Hudson community would no longer
      have access to some of the hardware and services that Kohsuke had
      accumulated over the years working on Hudson at Sun Microsystems. While we
      are still happily part of the
      <a href="http://java.net/">Java.net</a> community, we’ve recognized the
      need for some community-owned resources and Hudson Labs was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the past couple months, a group within the Hudson community, “infra”
      (short for “infrastructure”), has been working to get machines set up and
      build the foundation for a more open Hudson project infrastructure.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-does-hudson-labs-provide">What does Hudson Labs provide?</h3>
    <!--break-->
    <h5 id="builds">Builds</h5>
    <p>
      One of the first tasks we set upon when building out Hudson Labs was to
      start improving the build and release process of Hudson by moving as much
      of it into a
      <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org">public Hudson instance</a>. Building
      Hudson itself, plugins and dependencies of the Hudson project, the Hudson
      Labs instance will help improve the reliability of the Hudson ecosystem
      across the board, and should serve as a useful tool for core and plugin
      developers.
    </p>
    <h5 id="mirroring">Mirroring</h5>
    <p>
      Thanks to the great team over at the
      <a href="http://www.osuosl.org"
        >Oregon State University Open Source Lab</a
      >
      (<a id="aptureLink_oz4HIIQKJD" href="http://twitter.com/osuosl">OSUOSL</a
      >), we’ve been able to build out
      <a href="http://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/hudson/">mirroring infrastructure</a>
      for Hudson to provide fast access to native packages and wars alike.
      Currently the OSUOSL only has mirrors inside the continental United
      States, so we’re reaching out to friends in Asia and Europe to extend the
      mirroring system.
    </p>
    <h5 id="information">Information</h5>
    <p>
      I’m currently working on re-working some of the blog posts you may have
      read over four months as more structured tutorials. I hope to provide an
      easily accessible knowledge-base for developing Hudson along with
      configuring Hudson for various platforms and development environments;
      this is a more difficult task so all the pieces aren’t entirely in place
      for this just yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, I’m very enthusiastic about Hudson’s future. Now that
      InfraDNA is up and running, Kohsuke’s renewed focus combined with the
      foundation of Hudson Labs and the uncommonly hospitable Hudson developer
      and user communities, the future is looking bright!
