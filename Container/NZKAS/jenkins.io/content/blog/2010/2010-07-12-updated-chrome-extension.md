The developer for the Hudson extension for Google Chrome, [Sebastian Sanitz](http://github.com/sanitz), emailed the `users@` list today to inform the community of an update to his **[fantastic extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hfncndbfmjmafoodaigpoicpbdfhhgdo)**. 

Sebastian's extension monitors [ci.hudson-labs.org](http://ci.hudson-labs.org) by default, but the URL and polling interval are both trivial to change. When any of the builds in the configured URL fail, you'll see a red "Fail" indicator, otherwise green "Ok".

If you're interested in contributing to the plugin, good news! It's open source! You can find it [on GitHub](http://github.com/sanitz/hudson-chrome-extension).
