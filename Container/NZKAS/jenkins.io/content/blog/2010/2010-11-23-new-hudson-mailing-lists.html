      />As Kohsuke
      <a href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/javanet-migration-status-update"
        >mentioned in this post</a
      >, the Java.net migration has caught just about everybody off-guard in the
      Hudson community.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tools we use hosted by Java.net are essentially locked from us until
      further notice (no ETA on the migration) which is, as you might imagine
      frustrating both for the core developers but <strong>hundreds</strong> of
      plugin developers that make Hudson the best damned CI server on the
      planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <strong>source code</strong> we’re working on getting something in
      place for contributions on
      <a href="https://github.com/hudson/hudson">GitHub</a> thanks to some
      assistance from the GitHub team.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <strong>mailing lists</strong> we’ve gone ahead and dumped Java.net
      mailing lists in favor of a collection of Google Groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/">hudson-dev</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/">hudson-users</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-commits/"
          >hudson-commits</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/hudson-issues/"
          >hudson-issues</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Contrary to popular belief, you
      <strong>do not need a Google account</strong> to subscribe to these lists,
      else we wouldn’t have chosen Google Groups. All you need to do is send an
      email to “hudson-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com” and you’ll receive a
      confirmation email from the mailing list server shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since our
      <a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org">issues.hudson-ci.org</a> isn’t
      actually hosted on Java.net, but rather on a machine provided by Oracle,
      they <em>should</em> continue to function as per usual. The login for the
      systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable
      they will be this week.
    </p>
    <p>
      I apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust
      that we’re likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.
