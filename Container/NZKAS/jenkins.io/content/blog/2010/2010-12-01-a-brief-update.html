      Let me be the first to say <strong>thank you all</strong> for your
      <a
        href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hudson-labs.org%2Fcontent%2Fwhos-driving-thing%2F"
        >overwhelming support</a
      >
      for Hudson and the work we’ve been doing. The Hudson community in general
      has always been incredibly supportive and friendly, but the outpouring of
      support from friends and users who’ve not previously spoken up has been
      awe inspiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, let’s get down to business. As
      <a href="http://www.hudson-labs.org/content/whos-driving-thing"
        >I covered yesterday</a
      >
      there is some bubbling frustration within the developer community
      regarding some project infrastructure decisions and Oracle’s reactions to
      them. If you can’t spare the time to read that novel of a blog post, the
      extremely shortened version is: devs want to move codebase to GitHub,
      Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks ensue).
    </p>
    <p>
      While there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors
      are debating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that
      best suits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple
      days, Kohsuke or Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the
      community after some of the options have been fully vetted. Please bear in
      mind that Hudson is a <strong>very</strong> big project with some fairly
      unique needs. We have <em>hundreds</em> of contributors committing either
      to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases
      occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We’ve been pinging folks
      who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make
      sure we’re covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this
      don’t come up again for the foreseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a
      lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want to make sure
      that it’s clear that this <em>is not</em> about “Us versus Oracle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal isn’t to “stick it to the man,” that doesn’t help make Hudson any
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to
      participate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration
      server available.
    </p>
    <p>Stay tuned :)</p>
