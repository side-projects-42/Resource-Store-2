      A great community of developers and users is one of the many things that
      make Hudson a great tool and a fun project to work with, after launching
      Continuous Blog as an extensions of that community earlier this week there
      are some thanks in order to those that helped spread the word about CB and
      in turn, Hudson. Thanks to:
