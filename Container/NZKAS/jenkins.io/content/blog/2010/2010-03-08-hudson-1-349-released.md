Last Friday, March 5th, Hudson 1.349 was pushed out into the wild with an even split of bug fixes and enhancements. Included in this release is Alan Harder's (a.k.a `mindless`) old data monitor code, discussed previously in the post "[Call for Testers: The older the better](http://blog.hudson-ci.org/content/call-testers-older-better)." Included in this release were further updates to the japanese and german localizations of Hudson; if you're interested in helping localize Hudson into more languages you can join the effort via the [Internationalization page on the wiki](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Internationalization).


Now for the breakdown of the 1.349 release:


#### Bug fixes
<ul class=image> 
  <li class=bug> 
    Fix deserialization problem with fields containing double underscore.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5768">issue 5768</a>)
  <li class=bug> 
    Fix deserialization problem for Exception objects where the XML has bad/old data.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5769">issue 5769</a>)
  <li class=bug> 
    Fix serialization problem with empty CopyOnWriteMap.Tree.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-5776">issue 5776</a>)

</ul> 

<br clear="all"/>
#### Enhancements
<ul>
  <li class=rfe> 
    Remote build result submission shouldn't hang forever even if Hudson goes down.
  <li class=rfe> 
    Added a monitor for old or unreadable data in XML files and a manage screen to assist
    in updating files to the current data format and/or removing unreadable data from plugins
    that are no longer active.  "Manage Hudson" page will show a link if any old/unreadable
    data was detected.
  <li class=rfe> 
    Added a mechanism to bundle <tt>init.groovy</tt> inside the war for OEM.
    (<a href="http://n4.nabble.com/preconfigured-hudson-war-tp1575216p1575216.html">report</a>)
  <li class=rfe> 
    Added an extension point to annotate console output.
    (<a href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/HUDSON-2137">issue 2137</a>)</ul>


<br clear="all"/>
#### Contributors
Hudson 1.349 contains **43** commits from 6 contributors, due to the merging in of Alan Harder's old-data-monitor branch the commit count is a bit off from the amount of code change that actually went out in 1.349.
