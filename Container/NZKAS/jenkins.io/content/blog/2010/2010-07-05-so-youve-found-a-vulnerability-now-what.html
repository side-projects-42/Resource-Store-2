      Hudson, like all web applications, is not immune from vulnerabilities that
      could open up attack vectors for malicious use. What puts Hudson in a
      league of its own compared to others is its ability to execute arbitrary
      commands on slave machines, or in the case of the EC2 plugin, execute
      arbitrary commands “in the cloud.” In light of all this, Hudson is quite
      secure and offers a variety of mechanisms to reduce the potential for
      exploits.

      Despite Hudson’s security track record, you’ve managed to find a
      vulnerability in Hudson, and decide to don your white hat and inform the
      Hudson team. First off, let me commend you on your brilliant decision to
      report the vulnerability, you are truly a leader among men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally immediate public disclosure of vulnerabilities is frowned upon
      as it doesn’t give us much time to react, investigate and patch the hole.
      For this reason there is the “<a
        href="http://issues.hudson-ci.org/browse/SECURITY"
        >SECURITY</a
      >” project in Hudson’s JIRA. The SECURITY project is a more locked down
      section of JIRA than the other projects and allows you to submit issues
      and have them reviewed by the Hudson core developers who can assess the
      vulnerability. When reporting the issue, it will be helpful to include
      information regarding the environment the Hudson instance is running in
      (such as the servlet container) as well as any pertinent reproduction
      steps so the team can reproduce, fix and verify with as little
      wheel-spinning as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens next wholly determines on the severity of the issue, if it’s
      a highly critical vulnerability, the team will likely make an
      out-of-schedule release and advise users to upgrade. If it’s a less
      critical hole, the fix will be included in an upcoming scheduled release.
      Either way, the Hudson team has a good track record of correct potential
      security holes in a timely fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the hole you’ve discovered has been patched and released, you can
      revel in the fact that you helped make Hudson better, thanks!
