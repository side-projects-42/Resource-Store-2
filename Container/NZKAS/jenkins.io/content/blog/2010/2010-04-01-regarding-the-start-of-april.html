    <p>
      I had briefly contemplating what sort of silly posts I could write to
      celebrate April Fool’s Day, when I sat down to write out some of them, I
      got a few sentences in and decided that they just weren’t funny enough.
      Either I have very high standards, or I’m terribly unfunny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web is awash with April Fool’s articles, comics, headlines and
      everything else, so instead I’m going to just give you a few useful links.
    </p>
    <p><strong>A couple of Twitter links</strong></p>
    <p>
      Besides the
      <span class="citation" data-cites="hudsonci">[@hudsonci]</span
      >(http://twitter.com/hudsonci) account, you can also follow a couple of
      Hudson’s more notable (or was it notorious?) hackers, such as our
      benevolent dictator,
      <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a>.
      <a href="http://twitter.com/bshine">Ben Shine</a> from Yahoo! who’s been
      working pretty hard on making Hudson prettier. Then there’s
      <a href="http://twitter.com/wakaleo">John Ferguson Smart</a> who’s been
      working on a
      <a
        href="http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book"
        >Hudson book</a
      >. Of course I’ve tried to collect as many Hudson contributors as possible
      in the
      <span class="citation" data-cites="contributors"
        >[@contributors Twitter list]</span
      >(http://twitter.com/hudsonci/contributors).

    <p><strong>Hacking Hudson</strong></p>
    <p>
      When starting to hack Hudson, it’s useful to start by understanding
      <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Building+Hudson"
        >how to build Hudson</a
      >. If hacking Hudson’s core isn’t your cup of tea, you can always start
      with the
      <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Plugin+tutorial"
        >plugin tutorial</a
      >
      and try your hand at writing another awesome Hudson plugin. If you find
      yourself struggling to find out what methods do what while you’re hacking,
      you can always visit the regularly updated,
      <a href="https://hudson.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/"
        >online Javadocs for Hudson</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Communicate</strong> The two primary mediums for communicating
      with the Hudson community are through the
      <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing%20List"
        >mailing lists</a
      >
      and the
      <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel"
        >IRC channel</a
      >. During “regular business hours” for the pacific standard time zone, you
      can usually get some decent real-time help or answers to most of your
      queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’d list more, but I’m too busy reading about
      <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/exclusive-google-to-go-nuclear/"
        >Google’s nuclear weapons program</a
      >. ;)
