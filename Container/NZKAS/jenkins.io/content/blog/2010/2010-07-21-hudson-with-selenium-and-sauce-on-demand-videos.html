      A few weeks ago, Kohsuke stopped by the
      <a href="http://meetup.com/seleniumsanfrancisco"
        >San Francisco Selenium Meetup</a
      >
      hosted by <a href="http://saucelabs.com">Sauce Labs</a> to talk about all
      things Selenium and Hudson related (with a bit of Sauce in there too).
    </p>
    <p>
      The good folks over at Sauce Labs have gotten around to posting some of
      the videos taken with Kohsuke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of embed the videos, I wanted to directly

          href="http://saucelabs.com/blog/index.php/2010/07/sfse-meetup-videos-hudson-with-selenium-sauce-ondemand/"
          >link to the post</a
        ></strong
      >
      and make sure that you all went over to check out Sauce Labs, theyâ€™re up
      to some interesting things over there.
