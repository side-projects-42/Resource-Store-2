      From time to time, we get a report of out of memory problems in Hudson.
      It’s frequent enough that
      <a
        href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/I'm+getting+OutOfMemoryError"
        >we have a dedicated Wiki page</a
      >
      that talks about how to obtain information to help devs work on the
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      So
      <a
        href="http://n4.nabble.com/Restarting-hudson-every-day-memory-leaks-td1311161.html"
        >the latest thread</a
      >
      from
      <a id="aptureLink_RTb6QLKuCh" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/davidwoon"
        >David Woon</a
      >
      was assumed to be one of those ordinary trouble-shooting sessions, but
      thanks to Gustaf Lundh, it turned out to be a very interesting exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we discovered was that the profiler I was using (<a
        id="aptureLink_VKTrt70n5i"
        href="http://www.yourkit.com/"
        >Your Kit Profiler</a
      >), was basically eliminating all the weak/soft references from the
      picture entirely. If we are looking for leaks, this was the right thing,
      as those references will be cleared before VM chokes with
      <tt>OutOfMemoryError</tt>. But because of this elimination, I was
      completely blind to the wasteful memory usage in Jelly, which are only
      reachable via soft references.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I used
      <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/mat/">Eclipse Memory Analyzer</a> and YJP
      side by side to look into Jelly’s memory usage, and based on that insight,
      I was able to substantially improve the memory usage and speed of Jelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I monitor my production Hudson deployment with
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/performance/jvmstat/visualgc.html"
        >VisualGC</a
      >, and the result was quite noticable. And I hope you’ll notice that the
      response from Hudson is also snappier.
    </p>
    <p>All these changes are a part of the latest 1.346 release.</p>
