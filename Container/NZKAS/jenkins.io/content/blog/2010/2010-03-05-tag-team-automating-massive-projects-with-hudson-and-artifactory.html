      For those of you living in or around Silicon Valley, next Wednesday (March
      10th) you might want to reserve some space around 6pm on your calendar.

      from
      <a id="aptureLink_gvHDYIidrI" href="http://twitter.com/artifrog">JFrog</a>
      will be presenting at the
      <a href="http://www.svjugfx.org/">Silicon Valley JavaFX Users Group</a>
      meeting at the Googleplex. Frederic and Yoav will be discussing and
      demonstrating how JFrog’s Artifactory works with Hudson to combine
      continuous integration with release management.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Join with the Artifactory team to realize the benefits of managing your
        software development life-cycle through continuous integration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frederic Simon (JFrog Chief Architect) and Yoav Landman (JFrog CTO) will
        demonstrate how to automate large-scale multi-module projects, using a
        fully-integrated platform with Artifactory and Hudson.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Maven, Gradle or Ivy builds, it is now possible to dynamically
        automate and manage the pyramidal stacks of Unit, Functional, and
        Integration Tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        This demo-based session will show you how Artifactory and Hudson
        together make it much easier to promote certified builds to milestone
        releases , and finally to general availability, while making sure all
        builds are fully reproducible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staying dynamic all through the development process avoids code freeze
        and provides very accurate feedback loops. This is crucial for
        Developers, QA teams, System and Integration testers, Users, Customers,
        and all the remaining actors of the development process.
      </p>
