--- :layout: post :title: Continuous Deployment on the new Digg :nodeid: 230 :created: 1279839537 :tags: - general - core - guest post - links - plugins - jenkinsci :author: abayer --- In my capacity as Build Guy at [Digg](http://digg.com), I've written up a blog post on our new continuous deployment/code review/pre-tested commit workflow. We're using a combination of Hudson, Git and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/" id="aptureLink_XCwvc3W24n">Gerrit</a>, <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/" id="aptureLink_6peu5fusib">Selenium</a> and more to make sure that every change going to Digg's [new site](http://new.digg.com) has been thoroughly tested.

**Read the whole post, with all the juicy details over [on Digg's Technology Blog](http://about.digg.com/blog/continuous-deployment-code-review-and-pre-tested-commits-digg4)!**
