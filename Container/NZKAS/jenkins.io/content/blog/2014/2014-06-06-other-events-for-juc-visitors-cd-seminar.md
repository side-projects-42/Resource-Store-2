If you will be on the US East Coast or in Berlin for JUC, some of the JUC sponsors are organizing separate events called [Continuous Delivery Seminar](http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit), which might be of interest to you. These events focus more on higher-level business value questions as well as vendor solutions that are difficult in community-focused JUC.

- [New York City on June 19](http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/nyc), the day after JUC US East — headlined by Forrester Research analyst Kurt Bittner  

- [Berlin on June 24](http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/berlin), the day before JUC Europe — headlined by Jan Hagen, author of _Confronting Mistakes: Lessons from the Aviation Industry when Dealing with Errors_  


Read more about the events [here](http://blog.cloudbees.com/2014/06/cd-summit-learn-from-continuous.html). The events are free and I've heard that there'll be some souveniors. I'm one of the speakers, and I'll be talking about Jenkins, as always!
