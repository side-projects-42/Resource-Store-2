Starting with the next 1.554.x LTS, the release model will [switch to the train model](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line), where we commit to dates and get whatever we can ship by that date.

Backporting window for 1.554.1 is almost closing, so if you want to have your favorite issues nominated for it, please see [the process](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line) in the Wiki and hurry!
