InfoQ has been [running a CI server survey](http://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server) for more than a month now, and here is the current result:

Jenkins has gotten more than 70% of the votes, once again proving the wide adoption among developers. If you are one of those who picked Cruise Control into the "considering" section, I'd encourage you to look around a bit more.

You can still [vote from their website or leave comments if you want](http://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server).

By the way, the design of two axes make no sense to me; for example, I'd order the adoption axis to "considering -&gt; migrating to -&gt; using now -&gt; moving away from", and the circle seems to imply two axes are somehow interchangeable, when it should probably be just in a checkerboard to indicate those are independent axes.
