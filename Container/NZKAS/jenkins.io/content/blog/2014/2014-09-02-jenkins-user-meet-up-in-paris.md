My apologies for the last minute announcement, but there will be a [Jenkins user meet-up in Paris on Sep 10th 7:00pm](http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203261692/), which is just next week. The event is hosted by Zenika. You'll hear from [Gregory Boissinot](https://twitter.com/gboissinot) and [Adrien Lecharpentier](https://twitter.com/alecharp) about plugin development, and I'll be talking about workflow.

It's been a while we do a meet-up in Paris. Looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible. The event is free, but [please RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203261692/) so that we know what to expect.
