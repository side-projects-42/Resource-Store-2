RebelLabs started annual [Geek Choice Awards](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/10-kick-ass-technologies-modern-developers-love/12/), and Jenkins was one of the 10 winners. See [the page they talk about Jenkins](http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/10-kick-ass-technologies-modern-developers-love/6/).

My favorite part is, to quote, "Jenkins has an almost laughably dominant position in the CI server segment", and "With 70% of the CI market on lockdown and showing an increasing rate of plugin development, Jenkins is undoubtably the most popular way to go with CI servers."
