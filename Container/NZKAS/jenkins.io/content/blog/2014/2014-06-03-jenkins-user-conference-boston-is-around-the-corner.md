Right now more than 300 people have registered and we’ve had to [release more tickets](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/jenkins-user-conference-us-east-boston-june-18-2014-tickets-10558652213)!

This year marks the butler’s first conference tour to [New England](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England). He has chosen [the fabulous Seaport hotel](http://www.seaportboston.com/) on the waterfront for a venue — a hotel that's far better than what I usually stay in :-). You can even take a water taxi to [see the sites](http://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boston) or get to and from the airport. For airport transfers, you can also just hop on [the silver line bus](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=SILVER) and arrive across the street from the hotel (the stop is called "[World Trade Center Station](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=25092&lat=42.349098&lng=-71.04206)".)

This year we have [an incredible line-up of speakers](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston). Attendees will be well fed, caffeinated, and even pickled if they choose... the afternoon break will feature BEvERages. And everyone gets this year’s Jenkins World Tour t-shirt.

Nothing about conference-throwing is cheap, so we’d like to take a moment to thank our generous JUC US East sponsors. It speaks so well for the JUC community that so many companies have stepped up to support Jenkins and produce a first-class conference. So here is the shout-out for them:
