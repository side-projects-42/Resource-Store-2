The usual suspects, such as CloudBees, XebiaLabs, SOASTA, PuppetLabs, et al are [doing a Jenkins-themed continuous delivery event series](http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/) called "cdSummit." The event is free, has a nice mix of user/vendor talks, and has an appeal to managers and team leads who are working on and struggling with continuous delivery and automation.

I've spoken in the past events, and I enjoyed the high-level pitches from various speakers.  
The last two events at Paris and London filled up completely, so I suspect others have liked them, too.

If you live near Chicago, Washington DC, or San Francisco, check out the date and see if you can make it. [RSVP is from here](http://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/). If you do, be sure to pick up Jenkins stickers and pin badges!
