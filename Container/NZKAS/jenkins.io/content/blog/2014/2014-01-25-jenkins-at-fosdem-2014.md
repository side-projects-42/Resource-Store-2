[FOSDEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM) is probably the biggest open-source developers' conference in Europe.

This year will be the 3rd year for us to be present in FOSDEM. There will be [a bunch of community people](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM), handing out flyers and stickers, showing Jenkins, and generally be available to talk to people! This year, we'll bring some Jenkins T-shirts to sell, and hopefully some bobble heads as well. So please be sure to drop by.

And if you are already involved in the Jenkins project and willing to help us man the booth, that'd be awesome! Looking forward to seeing you!
