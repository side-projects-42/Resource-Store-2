Tomorrow in Jenkins office hours, Surya Gaddipati will be going over [DotCi](https://github.com/jenkinsci/dotci), a package of features that integrates Jenkins closely with GitHub, configuration via .ci.yml file in source tree, built-in Docker support and MongoDB backend.

I think there's a number of interesting pieces here that could be split into individual plugins for reuse, and possible alignment with existing efforts like [Script Security plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Script+Security+Plugin) or [Literate plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin).

To record the show, [this event will be in a different hangout from the usual one](https://plus.google.com/events/cmatf87mb6cfo090e063l10709g), but [the time is the same](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20140702T11&p1=224&ah=1&sort=1). Looking forward to seeing you!
