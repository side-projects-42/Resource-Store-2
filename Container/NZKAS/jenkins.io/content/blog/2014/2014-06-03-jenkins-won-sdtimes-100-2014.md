For the 5th year in a row, Jenkins project won [SDTimes 100, 2014](http://sdtimes.com/content/article.aspx?ArticleID=71295&page=4) this year under DevOps and SCM categories, along with other open-source projects like Chef, Docker, Git, LLVM, and Puppet.

I'd like to take this opportunity to once again thank the community for keeing us going strong. There's [a lot](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/qrG7bAnZSHQ) of [interesting](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/zDaX4yiWLLw) efforts [going on](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/l5vrC8BqVJQ) in [the project](https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness), as always, so expect more stuff to come out from us in the coming days!
