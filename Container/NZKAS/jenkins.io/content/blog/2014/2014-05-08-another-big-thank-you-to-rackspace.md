As the Jenkins project grows, [the need for our infrastructure has been growing](https://jenkins-ci.org/content/come-join-infra-team). [Our Jenkins-on-Jenkins](https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/) needs more build slaves, we need more servers to run our infrastructure services.

And it was [once again](https://jenkins-ci.org/content/big-thanks-rackspace) Rackspace who stepped up to the plate; they have kindly donated us more [cloud servers](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/). I also use Rackspace for one of my personal servers, and when I went back to their admin console this time, I noticed that they've added [a lot more services](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/) to their offering.

I am setting up these boxes as I write this. A huge thank you for Rackspace for their support of this project. And if you are interested in using Rackspace cloud servers as elastic build slaves, [jclouds plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JClouds+Plugin) is your friend.
