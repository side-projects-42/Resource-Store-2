I've uploaded pictures I've taken during JUC Boston and JUC Berlin.

[JUC Berlin pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/sets/72157645016261249/) starts with pre-conference beer garden meet-up. See [Vincent Latombe](http://github.com/vlatombe) gives a talk about [Literate plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin). I really appreciated his coming to this despite the fact that the event was only a few days before his wedding:

In [JUC Boston pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/sets/72157645015219907/), you can see some nice Jenkins lighting effect, as well as my fellow colleague Corey Phelan using World Cup to lure attendees into a booth:
