The community booth was very busy. We have people like Dean Yu (board), Andrew Bayer (board), Mark Waite (git), Jesse Glick (workflow and core), Daniel Beck (core), Vincent Latombe (literate), Steven Christou (subversion) and Owen Mehegan (community outreach) talking to people all day long.</p><br/>
