      Over the past few weeks there has been a vibrant discussion happening on
      the
      <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jenkinsci-dev/topics"
        >jenkinsci-dev@</a
      >
      mailing list as to what “<a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0"
        >Jenkins 2.0</a
      >” means. While Jenkins does not currently adhere to
      <a href="http://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, the change of a
      major version number does indicate a major milestone for the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project founder,
      <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> presented his
      vision for <strong>Jenkins 2.0</strong> in a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eVyc_n8i1c">office hours</a>
      session, the slides for which can be found
      <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ikbbQoMvus_l_q23BxXhYXnW9S5zsVNwIKZ9N8udg4"
        >in this Google Presentation</a
      >. Roughly paraphrasing Kohsuke’s vision, 2.0 is primarily about making
      things better for the thousands of users out there.

    <p>
      This week, we’ll be reviewing some <em>key areas</em> of the “Jenkins 2.0”
      proposal. Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these
      proposals, going from Jenkins internals to user interface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today’s post involves a proposal to introduce a policy for
      <strong>API deprecation</strong> from community members
      <a href="https://github.com/olivergondza">Oliver Gondža</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/daniel-beck">Daniel Beck</a>. Extensibility is
      the heart of Jenkins, but over the past ten years we’ve not had a proper
      API deprecation policy other than “try not to break plugins, ever.”
    </p>
    <p>Daniel, expanding more on the problem wrote:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        We have no backward compatibility policy besides “compatibility
        matters”. With 1000+ plugins and basically the entire core being
        available to plugins, a lot of difficult or impossible to remove cruft
        has accumulated over the last ten years. This limits both what can be
        changed in core, and makes documentation difficult to use for plugin
        developers.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The two have put together a detailed proposal under
      <strong
        ><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035"
          >JENKINS-31035</a
        ></strong
      >
      which suggests we:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        limit the availability in APIs (classes, methods, fields, …) provided by
        core to a number of releases. Depending on the feature, this can range
        from a few months, to a few years (e.g. two years being about 100
        releases of Jenkins and eight LTS baselines).
      </p>
      <p>[…]</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I highly encourage you to read the entire proposal
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035"
        >on the issue tracker</a
      >, where we are trying to collect feedback/history.
    </p>
    <h3 id="providing-feedback">Providing Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      We’re asking you to read the proposal in
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31035"
        >JENKINS-31035</a
      >
      and provide feedback if you have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have ever logged in to the
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">issue tracker</a> or the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/">wiki</a>, you have a “Jenkins user
      account” which means you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote
      for, or comment on the issue linked above.
    </p>
    <p>
      (<em>note</em>: if you have forgotten your password, use
      <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/account/">the account app</a> to reset
      it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
      approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.
    </p>
    <p>Stay tuned, and help make Jenkins 2.0 great!</p>
