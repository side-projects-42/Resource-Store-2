      A lot of people are using the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/README.md"
        >Workflow plugin</a
      >, but as with any scripting environment, users often have to start from
      scratch and learn the same lessons and shortcuts that other users have
      already learned. While there are blog posts from developers and users in
      various places, and some samples in the Workflow plugin documentation,
      more examples and tips and tricks are always, always useful. To help with
      that, we’ve created the
      <em
        ><a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples"
          >workflow-examples</a
        ></em
      >
      repository on GitHub, as a place to store community-developed Workflow
      scripts that can help new users get started, show how to accomplish some
      non-trivial goals, and find tips and trick for taking your Workflow
      pipeline to the next level.
    </p>
    <p>The repository has four directories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>docs/</code> - documentation, guides, and more. Including a
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples/blob/master/docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md"
          >Best Practices document</a
        >. We’d love to see more contributions to that doc, as well as any new
        ones that would be helpful to Workflow users!
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>workflow-examples/</code> - general Workflow examples, showing how
        to use a given plugin with Workflow, quirks of the Workflow DSL syntax,
        and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>global-library-examples/</code> - examples of how to write code
        for
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/cps-global-lib/README.md"
          >the Workflow global library</a
        >.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>jenkinsfile-examples/</code> - Sample
        <a
          href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#creating-multibranch-projects"
          >Jenkinsfiles</a
        >
        or other Workflow scripts from SCM .
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      During <a href="/content/hacksgiving-left-overs">Hacksgiving</a> some
      initial content was added, but not everything is covered yet, which is why
      I’m posting this - more is needed. We’d love to see your tips, examples,
      gotchas and more. If you’ve got Workflow scripts you’d like to contribute,
      please read the
      <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples#introduction"
        >README</a
      >
      and send a
      <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-examples/pulls"
        >pull request</a
      >. Thanks!
