      As I mentioned in
      <a href="/content/fosdem-2016-travel-grant-program">yesterday’s post</a>,
      we’re planning a “Contributor Summit” on February 1st, after
      <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016">FOSDEM 2016</a> (January 30th/31st), to
      focus on Jenkins 2.0. Since many of us
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM+2016"
        >are already planning</a
      >, the Monday following the event turned out to be the ideal time to
      discuss 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Note:</em> If you’re not already familiar with some of the key
      proposals that were put forth, you can review them in the
      <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposals"
        >Jenkins 2.0 proposals summery page</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve hosted
      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203777932/">one</a> or
      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/126595572/">two</a>
      Contributor Summits in the past, and they’re usually a day-long event
      where we try to gather a number of Jenkins core/plugin developers and
      active/power users to have detailed discussions around the theme of the
      summit. For this “Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit” we do not have a
      complete agenda yet, but we will post that to the
      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/"
        >Meetup event</a
      >
      once it is fully prepared in the next couple weeks.
    </p>
    <p>Suffice it to say, we’ll be discussing a lot!</p>
    <h3 id="venue-and-rsvp">Venue and RSVP</h3>
    <p>
      The Contributor Summit will be hosted in a
      <a href="https://cloudbees.com">CloudBees</a> office at:
      <a
        href="https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Rue+des+Colonies%2C+11%2C+Belgium%2C+be"
        >Rue des Colonies, 11, Brussels, Belgium</a
      >. If you’re already planning on attending FOSDEM, the office is near
      Grand Place and Cafe Delerium (where the Friday beer event is hosted).
    </p>
    <p>
      The venue is of limited size, so if you’re planning to join us,
      <strong>please</strong> RSVP to
      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/"
        >the Meetup event</a
      >
      as soon as you’re certain you will be able to attend. If you find yourself
      unable to attend, please remove yourself from the list to ensure that we
      can fit as many active contributors into the office as possible!
