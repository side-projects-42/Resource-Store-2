      We’re currently setting up a program to support community members’ travel
      to Jenkins community events. Our goal is to enable more members of the
      community to meet each other and exchange ideas in person.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re still hashing out the details, but it’ll be available to every
      Jenkins community member. Apply, telling us what Jenkins-related event
      you’d like to attend and how awesome you are, and we may support your
      travel with up to 500 USD. For details on how this will work, see the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program"
        >current draft of the travel grant program</a
      >.

      The first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya
      from Pune, India. He was

      next week—and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether
      the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the
      conclusion that this would be a good idea—so good in fact, that we decided
      to build a regular program from it.

      Are you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the
      cost of travel? We may be able to help you out!
