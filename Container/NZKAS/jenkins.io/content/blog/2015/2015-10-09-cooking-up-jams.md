There's been some active discussions and planning around [Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs)](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup) specifically in the following cities:

- [Rennes, France](http://www.meetup.com/Rennes-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/)
- Seville, Spain
- Seattle, Washington
- Barcelona,Spain
- [Raleigh, North Carolina](http://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/)
- [Atlanta, Georgia](http://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/)

I wanted to gauge Jenkins interests in these cities, so let us know at <jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com> if you live in one of these areas, and if you would be interested in becoming a member or be involved in JAM one way or another!

Of course, if the city you live in currently does not have a JAM and you're interested in paying it forward, [here's HOW YOU can become a JAM organizer.](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup)
