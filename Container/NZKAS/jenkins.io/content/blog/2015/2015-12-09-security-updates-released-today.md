We released Jenkins updates today that include important security fixes: 1.641 and 1.625.3. For detailed information about the security content of these updates, see the [security advisory](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2015-12-09).

One of these fixes, SECURITY-95, results in possible problems in plugins such as **Maven Plugin**, **Javadoc Plugin**, and **HTML Publisher Plugin**, so make sure to [read all about that in the wiki](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy).

Please note that the update site may lag a bit behind. If you want to update as soon as possible, download the releases from our site.
