[Slides and video from JUC Europe](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/europe) are now available online!

If you made it to London to attend this year's JUC Europe, [**I hope you enjoyed the conference**](https://flic.kr/p/uER3fe), met plenty of community members and learned more about Jenkins. Now that the slides and video are up, you can revisit your [favorite talks](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/europe/02-02-1130-cruz) or "attend" the ones that you missed...all at your leisure.

If you were unable to attend JUC Europe, well, now you can! The slides and video are [here](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/europe) so you can "attend" any time you want. If JUC LIVE seems more appealing to you, there is **one** date left in the 2015 Jenkins User Conference World Tour: **JUC U.S. West is September 2-3 in Santa Clara, CA.
