It seems a bit unreal, but the [last JUC agenda](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west) for 2015 is now online. [Jenkins User Conference U.S. West](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west) is the last JUC of the year running from September 2-3 in Santa Clara, CA. So, if you haven't attended JUC yet this year, [**this is your chance!**](https://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1697214)

[Register](https://www.regonline.com/Register/Checkin.aspx?EventID=1697214) with a friend to take advantage of the community's 2-for-1 deal and get two tickets for the price of one.
