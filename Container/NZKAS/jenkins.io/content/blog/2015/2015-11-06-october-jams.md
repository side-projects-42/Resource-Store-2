It is great to see the pick up of local activities through hosted JAMs. In October, the Jenkins community hosted [Atlanta JAM](http://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/events/225877826/) and [Bay Area JAM](http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/225860998/). Many thanks to our sponsors: [Ericsson](http://www.ericsson.com/), [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/), [Blazemeter](https://blazemeter.com/), [NetRoadShow](https://www.netroadshow.com/nrs/wp/default.html).

Here’s a summary of what was discussed:

- [Atlanta](http://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/events/225877826/) JAM - Jenkins workflow and Docker to reduce friction in DevOps efforts.
- [Bay Area](http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/225860998/) JAM- Performance testing strategies, incorporating performance tests into Jenkins workflows and the metrics that matter most for troubleshooting and diagnosing issues.

A look forward to November and December:
