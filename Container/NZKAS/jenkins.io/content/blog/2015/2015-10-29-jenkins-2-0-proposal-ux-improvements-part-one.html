      We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what “<a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0"
        >Jenkins 2.0</a
      >” is going to include. Today we’ll be diving into the most noticeable
      changes being proposed for Jenkins 2.0: the User Experience (UX)
      improvements
    </p>
    <p>Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation"
          >Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core"
          >Splitting Groovy out of ‘core’</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-pipeline-code-front-and-center"
          >Pipeline as code front and center</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The UX improvements being proposed aren’t necessarily as uniform as the
      proposals from earlier in the week but represent a large amount of
      prototype and exploratory work done by folks like
      <a href="https://github.com/tfennelly">Tom Fennelly</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/gusreiber">Gus Reiber</a> and a few others.
      Those following the dev list may have already seen some of these proposals
      in some of the “mega threads” that we have had discussing potential UI/UX
      improvements previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The improvements proposed for 2.0 can be found under
      <strong
        ><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31156"
          >JENKINS-31156</a
        ></strong
      >. The most promising proposal under this issue is to update the
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9802"
        >plugin manager experience</a
      >.

    </center>
    <p>
      Another very important proposal for 2.0 worth mentioning is the proposal
      to
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-21092"
        >update UI work well on mobile devices</a
      >.
