It's that time of the year again: [2015 Jenkins User Conference Registration is OPEN for all cities.](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/) This year, we are making some changes to JUC â€” JUC will be a two-day event in three out of the four cities across the globe. You will get opportunities to network with other users and developers in the community, learn more about how other people are using Jenkins and attacking broader continuous delivery problem. As always, we love to meet & talk to you to learn what you are doing with Jenkins. To get the sense of how JUC is like, take a look at our past JUC reports like [this](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/juc-berlin-summary) and [this](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/juc-boston-what-day).
