      As I mentioned in
      <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation"
        >yesterday’s post</a
      >, there’s been a lot of discussion recently about what “<a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0"
        >Jenkins 2.0</a
      >” means. In a recent “Office Hours” session,
      <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> presented his
      vision for <strong>Jenkins 2.0</strong> in a
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eVyc_n8i1c">office hours</a>
      session, the slides for which can be found
      <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ikbbQoMvus_l_q23BxXhYXnW9S5zsVNwIKZ9N8udg4"
        >in this Google Presentation</a
      >. Roughly paraphrasing Kohsuke’s vision, 2.0 is primarily about making
      things better for the thousands of users out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      This week, we’ll be reviewing some <em>key areas</em> of the “Jenkins 2.0”
      proposal. Asking you, the user community, to provide feedback on these
      proposals, going from Jenkins internals to user interface.
    </p>
    <p>Thus far we’ve covered:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation"
          >Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Today’s post involves a proposal originally from community member
      <a href="https://github.com/jglick">Jesse Glick</a> who has proposed in
      <strong
        ><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068"
          >JENKINS-29068</a
        ></strong
      >
      that <a href="http://groovy-lang.org">Groovy</a> be split out from the
      “core” Jenkins distribution. The linked issue expands on what the problem
      is here:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Currently Jenkins embeds a distribution of Groovy into “core” for a
        variety of scripting and management tasks. This version of Groovy is
        locked into core in such a way that users cannot upgrade Groovy
        independently from Jenkins itself. If the Jenkins-bundled version were
        upgraded to a different major version, it may break users’ custom
        scripts as well as plugins that use Groovy due to API changes.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The proposal is relatively straight-forward and affects the many different
      users and use-cases for the embedded Groovy scripting support in Jenkins:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        For ease of maintenance and modularity it would be useful to split
        Jenkins’ use of Groovy into a library plugin; different clients could
        request 1.x and 2.x simultaneously by using different versions of the
        library, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stuff in core using Groovy that would need to either be put in this
        library (if infrastructure for other features) or put in another plugin
        depending on it (if first-class features themselves):
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I selected this proposal to feature on this blog, despite its rather
      technical underpinnings, it will affect core developers, plugin
      developers, power and casual users alike. I encourage everybody to read
      through the proposal and its potential impact
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068"
        >on the issue tracker</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h3 id="providing-feedback">Providing Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      We’re asking you to read the proposal in
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29068"
        >JENKINS-29068</a
      >
      and provide feedback if you have it.

      If you have ever logged in to the
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">issue tracker</a> or the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/">wiki</a>, you have a “Jenkins user
      account” which means you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote
      for, or comment on the issue linked above.

      (<em>note</em>: if you have forgotten your password, use
      <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/account/">the account app</a> to reset
      it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
      approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay tuned for the rest of the week as we keep with our theme of going
      “from the inside out” and help us make Jenkins 2.0 great!
