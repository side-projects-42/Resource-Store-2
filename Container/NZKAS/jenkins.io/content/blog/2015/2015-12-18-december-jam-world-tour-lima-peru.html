      Although December is a short month due to the holidays, there has been a
      good amount of local Jenkins activities that took place regardless of
      holiday obligations. Today and tomorrow I will be doing a series of posts
      to summarize December JAM World Tour. Special thanks to the JAM organizers
      and co-organizers who made it all happen in these cities:

      <li>St.Petersburg, Russia</li>
      <li>Toulouse, France</li>

    </ul>

      On December 9
      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Lima-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/">Lima JAM</a>
      hosted their first Jenkins meetup in Lima, Peru. There were attendance
      from various roles of DevOps: Dev, QA, and Ops. There was also a good
      mixture of different levels of Jenkins users, some were new and just
      starting to use Jenkins while others had extensive Jenkins experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group has been invited by Docker and Ansible meetup organizers for a
      joint event in January to showcase technologies from Jenkins, Docker, and
      Ansible. Congrats to Lima JAM group.
