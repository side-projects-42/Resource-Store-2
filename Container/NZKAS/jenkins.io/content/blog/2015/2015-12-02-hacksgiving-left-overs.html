      Last week we hosted our first
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015"
        >Hacksgiving</a
      >
      event, a two-day virtual hackathon with a number of recorded sessions and
      plenty of pull requests submitted,
      <a href="https://github.com/rtyler">I</a> would say it was a success! I
      would like to thank everybody who took the time to watch, chat and present
      in the Hacker Hangout.

    <p>
      Now that everybody has had time to recover from the turkey and travel, we
      have some videos of the sessions sliced out and ready for publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the recorded sessions, there were a number of notes
      captured with useful links associated with practically each session. You
      can find those notes

    <p>
      This session was hosted by
      <a href="https://github.com/rtyler">rtyler</a> and meant to provide a
      cursory overview of where to get started with contributing to the Jenkins
      project

    <p>
      This session was given both days of Hacksgiving by
      <a href="https://github.com/christ66">schristou</a> and does a really
      great job of introducing the viewer to getting started with developing a
      Jenkins plugin with Java.

        >IRC channel</a
      >
      had some
      <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin">Workflow</a>
      questions and <a href="https://github.com/jglick">Jesse Glick</a> jumped
      into the Hacker Hangout to help us out!

      Another impromptu session, this time with
      <a href="https://github.com/daniel-beck">danielbeck</a> hosting. In this
      session Daniel walks through a plugin he was working on for Hacksgiving
      and adds internationalization support while answering a few questions here
      and there.

    <p>
      Kicking off day two of Hacksgiving,
      <a href="https://github.com/rtyler">rtyler</a> hosted a session on the new
      <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.io"
        >statically-generated Jenkins site</a
      >. The new site will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for
      contribution to Jenkins documentation and blogs, by pushing everything
      through GitHub.

    <p>
      This was the last session of Hacksgiving, hosted by
      <a href="https://github.com/abayer">abayer</a> and ended up being more
      like a casual discussion of the current status and future work in the
      plugin development ecosystem.
