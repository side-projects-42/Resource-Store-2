      We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what “<a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0"
        >Jenkins 2.0</a
      >” is going to include, today we’re discussing my personal favorite, which
      I believe will have a tremendously positive impact for years to come (not
      to be too biased!): moving the “Pipeline as Code” support in Jenkins to
      the front and center.
    </p>
    <p>Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation"
          >Introducing a policy for API deprecation</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core"
          >Splitting Groovy out of ‘core’</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Today’s proposal comes from project founder
      <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke">Kohsuke Kawaguchi</a> titled “<strong
        ><a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152"
          >Pipeline as code front and center</a
        ></strong
      >” and represents perhaps the most important and dramatic shift we hope to
      make in Jenkins 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      This functionality has existed through the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workflow+Plugin"
        >workflow plugin</a
      >, which we have discussed at various Jenkins events before but if you’re
      not aware of some of the power behind it, check out this presentation from
      <a href="https://github.com/jglick">Jesse Glick</a>:

      The proposal in
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152"
        >JENKINS-31152</a
      >
      expands on the problem we aim to address:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The default interaction model with Jenkins has been very web UI driven,
        requiring users to manually create jobs, then manually fill in the
        details through a web browser. This requires large amounts of effort to
        create and manage jobs to test and build multiple projects and keeps the
        actual configuration of a job to build/test/deploy a project separate
        from the actual code being built/tested/deployed. This prevents users
        from applying their existing CI/CD best practices to the job
        configurations themselves.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To address this, Kohsuke is proposing that we :</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Introduce a new subsystem in Jenkins that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          lets you design a whole pipeline, not just a single linear set of
          tasks
        </li>
        <li>
          stores the said pipeline configuration as human-editable
          <code>Jenkinsfile</code> in your SCM
        </li>
        <li>
          makes it automatic to set up new pipelines when
          <code>Jenkinsfile</code> is added
        </li>
        <li>differentiates multiple branches in the same repository</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is the key new feature that positions Jenkins for continuous
        delivery use cases and other more complex automations of today.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Kohsuke’s proposal is largely about bringing together a lot of already
      existing pieces together to provide a <em>very</em> compelling experience
      for new and existing users alike. I hope it is clear now why this proposal
      is so exciting to me.

    <h3 id="providing-feedback">Providing Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      We’re asking you to read the proposal in
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31152"
        >JENKINS-31152</a
      >, which itself have some additional tickets linked under it, and provide
      feedback if you have it.
    </p>

      If you have ever logged in to the
      <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org">issue tracker</a> or the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/">wiki</a>, you have a “Jenkins user
      account” which means you’ll be able to log into the issue tracker and vote
      for, or comment on the issue linked above.

      it.)
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re going to review feedback, make any necessary adjustments and either
      approve or reject the proposal two weeks from today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay tuned for a couple more posts covering proposals to improve the
      Jenkins interface and user experience!
