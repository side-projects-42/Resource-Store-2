      Thank you to <a href="http://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> for sponsoring
      the yummy burrito bar and offered up their brand new auditorium to host
      Jenkins Developers and Users Meetup group on Dec 16. We had 96 RSVPs which
      was impressive. Our speaker for the evening was
      <strong>Akshay Dayal</strong>, Software Engineer at Google. Akshay’s
      session was about Scaling Jenkins - how and why Google decided to scale
      their existing Jenkins cluster (OSS) to meet their security/availability
      and failover requirements and how heavy automation played an important
      role in this effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second talk was about how Google worked with Jenkins to read config
      data externally. Slides are listed below. The video will be posted on
      <a href="http://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226844066/"
        >the meetup page</a
      >) once it becomes available.
