I hope many of you have had a chance to see [the Jenkins 2.0 thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/vbXK7JJekFw).  
I'm going to use [the office hours next Wednesday](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours) to go through this proposal.

This is still primarily for developers in the project, as it's "just" a proposal with lots of details unspecified. It's more meant to help people understand where I'm coming from and what goals I have in mind for this effort.

As always, this will be on Hangout on air. The event page is [here](https://plus.google.com/events/co46heshe6i4io1dsaaj1h3th2c), and if you want to participate in the discussion, join [here](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYfvk_ZBO4dCmxysNPfi-R5_xlkgscU-r9WDq_8zXDv6VnN3kg). Read-only viewers should use [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl5xfqtiNko) to watch, and you can still send questions in real time to IRC and I'll make sure to [go through them](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat).
