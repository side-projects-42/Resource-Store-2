In continuing [my infra upgrade work](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/confluence-migration-weekend), this weekend Iâ€™ll be migrating JIRA to another server.

This will make upgrade more manageable and testable. The service will be disrupted for a few hours. Check out our [<span class="citation" data-cites="jenkinsci">@jenkinsci</span> on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenkinsci/) for up-to-the-minute status.

Once the migration is done, the next step is to upgrade them.
