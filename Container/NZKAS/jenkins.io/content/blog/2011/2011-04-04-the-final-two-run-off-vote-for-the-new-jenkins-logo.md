A [little over a week ago](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/polls-are-open-jenkins-logo-contest) we opened the polls to the larger user-base to vote for the **_new and improved_** Jenkins logo. After receiving hundreds of votes, we are now ready to enter the final round of voting (click images to see larger versions in a new window).

Voting will **end** April 9th at 23:59 UTC, so make sure to tell your friends, coworkers and bus drivers to get their votes in as soon as possible!
