      I’ve just added three events coming up in the next few weeks to
      <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/calendar">the Jenkins calendar</a>.
      Conveniently, they are all events I’ll be attending while traveling around
      Western Europe!

          <a href="http://jugcologne.org">The Cologne JUG</a> is having a meetup
          on Saturday, June 25th, starting at 2pm. We’ll be talking about
          Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and
          more talk! You can find more information and sign up at
          <a href="https://www.xing.com/events/jugc-jenkins-town-763587">Xing</a
          >.

          A few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a
          meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I’ll be
          giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by
          Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for
          Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After
          that, we’ll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can
          find more information and sign up at
          <a

          A week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well,
          on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We’ll be meeting up at the
          Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking. You can find more
          information and sign up at
          <a
            href="http://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Integration-London/events/21752121/"
