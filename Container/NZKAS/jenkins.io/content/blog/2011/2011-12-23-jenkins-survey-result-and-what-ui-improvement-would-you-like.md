[Jenkins community survey result is in](http://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/12/jenkins-community-survey-results-82.html), which shows a number of interesting stats for us developers, such as 82% of people saying their Jenkins is mission critical, or the spread of distributed builds, especially compared to [my earlier similar usage analytics](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2009/01/hudson_usage_an.html).

But just as interesting is the free-form answers to questions like “If there was anything you could you change about Jenkins CI, what would it be?”, and while the answer is colorful, there are a few common themes that one can easily spot.

One of them is “nothing!”, which made me feel good, but another is “UI improvement.” And incidentally, Domi has started [a thread in the Jenkins-users list](http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/Jenkins-UI-enhancements-td4196887.html) about this exact topic a week ago.

The idea is to brainstorm what kind of concrete improvements people would like to see, then run them through some real user experience designers and decide which ones are good ideas and which ones are not.

I find this thread useful — so much so that one of those ideas (always show the “Save” button at the bottom in the config page) is already implemented toward the next release of Jenkins. So if you have some thoughts to share, please chime in on that thread.
