      As I had mentioned in
      <a
        href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/installing-plugins-has-always-been-easy-now-its-fast-too"
        >a previous post</a
      >
      back when Jenkins was called something else, who can remember what
      anymore, I spent a lot of time working on a mirroring network. With our
      departure from any and all Oracle infrastructure, this mirroring network
      has now become our sole distribution mechanism for pushing out
      <strong>all</strong> releases and <strong>all</strong> plugins, in short,
      <strong>lots and lots of bits</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just how much data are we now distributing through the Jenkins mirror
      network?
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><big>Over 52GB in 24 hours</big></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here’s the following in terms of a loose breakdown of the number of files
      served over the past day:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>788 <code>.war</code></li>
      <li>447 <code>.deb</code></li>
      <li>290 <code>.rpm</code></li>
      <li>1759 <code>.hpi</code> (plugins)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We’re off to a great start! I’d like to extend my thanks again to the
      <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a> and
      <a href="http://mirrors.xmission.com">XMission</a> for their help getting
      the Jenkins mirrors functional as soon as possible
    </p>
