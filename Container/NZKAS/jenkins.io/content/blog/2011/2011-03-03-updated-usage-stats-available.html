    <p>
      Updated usage statistics are now available at
      <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/census">http://jenkins-ci.org/census</a>
      This data has been scrubbed of distinguishing information as much as
      possible, filtered for installations we’ve seen at least twice a month
      with at least one job set up, and split up into monthly JSON files.
      Starting with August, we only have data on installations of version 1.368
      or later - before that, reports go to the old Oracle-owned server, and we
      aren’t able to retrieve them. So that’s why you’ll see a fairly hefty drop
      in install count, etc from July to August.
    </p>

      I haven’t had a chance to do any analysis to speak of on the data. I
      intend to get the
      <a href="http://bit.ly/aC6wIo">plugin usage spreadsheet</a> updated n the
      next few days, but I wanted to make this data available to you all ASAP.
      If you come up with any interesting analysis or use of the data, please
      let us know!
