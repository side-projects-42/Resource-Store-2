      (This was sent as an email to the Hudson dev and users mailing lists after
      voting concluded, but I thought it’d be good to post it here as well.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The vote is closed, and the results are in. More than half of the total
      votes were from ineligible voters, but the result would have been the same
      either way. The final result of all eligible votes is as follows: 214
      votes to rename, and 14 for the status quo. You can see the individual
      votes

      So what does this mean now? Well, it means Jenkins lives. We’ve registered
      jenkins-ci.org, though it’s empty at the moment. In the coming days, we
      will be renaming the existing Google Groups to jenkins-*<span
        class="citation"
        data-cites="googlegroups.com"
        >@googlegroups.com</span
      >, renaming the Twitter account from
      <span class="citation" data-cites="hudsonci">@hudsonci</span> to
      <span class="citation" data-cites="jenkinsci">[@jenkinsci]</span
      >(http://twitter.com/jenkinsci), and renaming our organization at Github
      from hudson to jenkinsci. I wanted to make sure everyone had notice ahead
      of time that this was happening, so that no one gets surprised by changes
      to their incoming mail, etc. As said before, the initial, interim
      governance board will consist of me, Kohsuke and, if he and Oracle are
      willing, Winston. If Winston is unwilling or unable to continue in that
      role with Jenkins, we will select a replacement interim member. The
      interim board will work on the details of a more permanent governance
      process going forward. Discussions on the infrastructure changes
      (including things like the Maven groupId/artifactIds, etc) will be in
      public, on these lists. We’re working to get the JIRA and wiki contents
      migrated over to the Jenkins site, and hope to work with Oracle to get
      that done in the next couple days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting aside logistics, I want to personally thank everyone for voting,
      and especially thank everyone who voted for renaming for supporting the
      Jenkins project and its future. Jenkins is not Oracle’s project, nor
      CloudBee’s project, nor my project, nor Kohsuke’s project - it’s the
      community’s project, and it’s going to thrive.
