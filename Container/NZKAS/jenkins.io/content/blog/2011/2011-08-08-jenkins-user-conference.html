        ></strong
      >
      on <strong>October 2nd</strong>.

      If you have your calendar at the ready, you’ll notice that October 2nd is

        >proposed agenda</a
      >
      has already been posted by Harpeet.

      As this is a community event, I’ll be sure to keep the updates coming on
      this site but you may want to add the
      <a href="http://blog.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees’ Blog</a> to your feed
      reader just in case (or just follow them on Twitter:
