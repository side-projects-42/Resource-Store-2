--- :layout: post :title: Jenkins Long-Term Release 1.409.2 is out :nodeid: 337 :created: 1316012713 :tags: - general - core - releases - lts :author: kohsuke --- We just posted the updated Long-term Release (LTS) of 1.409.2.

Just as a recap, with LTS releases, we plan on providing a release train that only has backported changes. 1.409.2 contains [a handful of important bug fixes](http://jenkins-ci.org/changelog-stable) since 1.409.1. For more about LTS, [see this wiki page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line).

Thanks to the heroic effort of those who are involved, namely Vojtech Juranek and a bunch of heroes, this release went through a rather rigorous testing, including all the automated tests we have plus [a considerable number of manual eye-ball tests](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+1.409.x+RC+Testing).

To download, click the "Long-Term Support Release" tab from [the top page](http://jenkins-ci.org/). If you've already been using LTS, you should start receiving update notifications soon.
