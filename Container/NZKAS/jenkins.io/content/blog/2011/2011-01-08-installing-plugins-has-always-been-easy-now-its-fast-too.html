      As one of the “men behind the scenes” of the Hudson project, a lot of my
      contributions tend to be in writing articles or handling infrastructure,
      anything to ensure folks like
      <a href="http://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> can continue to make
      Hudson great without being distracted by inane system administration
      tasks. This past week, one of my long-running infrastructure projects has
      finally “gone live,” making downloads of plugins and packages faster than
      ever!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some number of months ago I became frustrated with the download speeds
      reported by our international users, while the majority of Hudson’s
      infrastructure is all colocated inside of the United States, there is a
      <strong>huge</strong> number of Hudson users and developers who are both
      in Europe and Asia.
    </p>
    <p>
      After discussing things with some of the folks that run
      <a href="http://download.opensuse.org">download.opensuse.org</a>, a
      <a href="http://mirrorbrain.org">MirrorBrain</a> powered redirector, I set
      out to build something similar. A mirroring network which could be easily
      managed and help direct users’ downloads to the geographically closest and
      fastest mirror available.
    </p>
    <h4 id="where-are-we-mirrored">Where are we mirrored?</h4>
    <p>
      Currently we have mirrors in a few locations within the United States, and
      one overseas:

        Southwest U.S. (Utah) -

    <h4 id="using-the-mirrors">Using the mirrors</h4>
    <p>
      If you’ve updated or installed plugins from within Hudson lately, guess
      what! You’re already using mirrors! In fact, since we flipped the switch
      on January 7th, over <strong>800</strong> plugins and
      <strong>600</strong> <code>hudson.war</code> updates have been downloaded
      from the mirroring network!
    </p>
    <!--break-->
    <p>
      If you’d like to download directly from the mirrors, you can browse on
      over to
      <a href="http://mirrors.hudson-labs.org">mirrors.hudson-labs.org</a>,
      which will redirect your request for specific files to the appropriate
      mirror based on your IP address. It’s just that easy!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are currently working with more providers to add additional mirrors,
      hopefully we’ll have an Asian mirror online within the next two weeks and
      if we’re lucky, we’ll find some more European mirrors too.

      I would like to thank the <strong>immensely</strong> helpful and
      supportive engineers over at the
      <a href="http://www.osuosl.org">OSUOSL</a> for offering gratis tech
      support, suggestions, and bandwidth to serve as our
      <em>primary</em> mirror.
