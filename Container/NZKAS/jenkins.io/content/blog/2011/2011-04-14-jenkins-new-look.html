      As you might have noticed
      <a href="http://twitter.com/jenkinsci/">Jenkins</a> finally has a
      <strong>brand spankin’ new logo!</strong> Over the past couple weeks we’ve
      run two series of votes,
      <a
        href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/polls-are-open-jenkins-logo-contest"
        >one for the initial 11 logo submissions</a
      >
      and then a final, run-off election, for the
      <a
        href="http://jenkins-ci.org/content/final-two-run-vote-new-jenkins-logo"
        >two most popular choices</a
      >. I’d like to take this opportunity to thank everybody that submitted
      logos! It is incredibly flattering to have so many people passionate about
      the project and willing to spend the time creating new art for us.

      At the end of the votes, there was a clear winner though, everybody seems
      to really love the submission by the folks over at
      <a href="http://thefrontside.net/">The FrontSide</a> which you can see
      adorning this very page.

      If you’d like to download the SVG version of the logo, or the variants in
      different sizes, I’ve gone ahead and uploaded a tarball and all the
      variants to
      <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/art/">this directory</a>, there is
      also a good
      <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/art/jenkins_colors.pdf"
        >color palette here</a
      >
      (<em>obligatory PDF warning</em>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once again, thank you to <strong>everybody</strong> that participated!
