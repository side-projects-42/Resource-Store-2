      You know that the night is going to be productive whenever
      <span class="citation" data-cites="kohsukekawa">@kohsukekawa</span> shows
      up, and last night was no exception. We talked about problems on the
      horizon, potential solutions, and then I spent the last half hour ripping
      a bit of code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth of the matter is that most of the changes that have to be done
      to Jenkins core have already been made, so now the bulk of the heavy
      lifting falls to the Ruby side of things (right now, me).
    </p>
    <p>Anyhow, on to the notes!</p>

      If you know Ruby and would like to be able to write Jenkins plugins with
      it, but don’t know the first thing about Jenkins and/or JRuby, that’s OK.
      You can help by implementing some of the
      <a
        href="https://github.com/cowboyd/jenkins-plugins.rb/tree/master/features"

      Ruby folk love their tests, and a plugin develompent solution won’t be
      complete unless testing is a breeze. That means that as we extract the
      plugin support library, we take make sure you can test plugin classes in
      isolation.

      On the Jenkins side, KK will think about how to run tests that require a
      full Jenkins environment. A system like this exists currently for testing
      java plugins, but some thought might be required on how to do this for
      Ruby.

      KK is going to jump in and write some rake tasks to take a ruby plugin
      structure and package it into a valid .hpi file, and with no maven
      involved. According to him, Ruby plugins aren’t the only system that wants
      to run maven-free. There is desire to be able to do plugin development
      with Gradle (another Java build system), so this could be a double win.

      8:30pm Central in North America, doesn’t seem to be a very good time.
      Especially for hackers in Asia Pacific. KK will investigate a new time
      that works for everybody and encourages more participation.
