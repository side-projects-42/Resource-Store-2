As if [getting a Kindle for reporting bugs](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/report-bugs-and-win-kindle) and [getting an AppleTV for filing a survey](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-community-survey) aren't enough, you can also [win an iPad for fixing an issue](http://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-community-contests.cb#bugbounty).

So if you've been thinking about tinkering with [Jenkins code base](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Repositories) but haven't done so yet, this is a great opportunity to get going. There's [documentation about how to get started](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins), and there's [Jenkins Office Hours](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours) and [IRC channel](http://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat) if you need some interactive help from existing devs. I think new features, not just bug fixes, would qualify, so long as it's recorded in the issue tracker. And similarly, I think the plugins would qualify, not just core.

Aside from iPad, there's one $50 Amazon gift certificate going out every week, which is almost a steal! So be sure to submit your entry!
