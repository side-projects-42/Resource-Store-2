Our [earlier appeal](/content/holiday-appeal-please-help-jenkins-pay-project-expense) for donation was a drastic boost to [our fund-raising drive](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Donation), (and looking at the twitter reactions, it feels like the Wikipedia parody we put on [Jenkins on Jenkins](http://ci.jenkins-ci.org/) helped spread the words — I guess jokes do work!

And I’m happy to report that we’ve successfully raised over $12000 as of today. That’s more than enough to pay off all the current balance and it should keep the project going for quite a while. I’ve assembled [the donor list](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Donors) in appreciation.

So once again, thanks everyone for their generous support!
