    <p>This post is long over-due and I really apologize for that.</p>
    <p>
      Some months ago we put out the call for “more slave machines!” through the
      mailing lists, sky-writers and twitter. We had a serious problem, for a
      continuous integration project, a <strong>large</strong> number of our
      plugins and dependencies weren’t being built in a continuous and automated
      fashion!
    </p>
    <p>
      We had some builds on a couple of flakey machines on home connections
      contributed by various individuals, until Rackspace stepped up in a
      <strong>big</strong> way and donated an infrastructure server for the
      project to use.

    <p>
      For months now, just about all plugins and core have been built and tested
      on <code>spinach</code>, the always-on machine in the Rackspace Cloud.
      Dutifully chugging away building core, plugin after plugin and
      occasionally getting flooded with work from
      <a href="http://twitter.com/fcamblor">Frederic Camblor’s</a> plugin
      compatibility tester!
    </p>
    <p>
      In hindsight, having a powerful infrastructure machine for nothing other
      than builds has helped us build great software faster; I can’t imagine how
      difficult things might be otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve personally had a lot of interaction with Rackspace engineers through
      the <a href="http://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack project</a> and have a
      number of friends who operate businesses on Rackspace/Rackspace Cloud
      hybrid infrastructures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The folks at Rackspace are top notch and I can’t thank them enough for
      contributing to the Jenkins project.
