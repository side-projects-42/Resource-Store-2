      Many of us have had occasion to think: “<em
        >I could make this project build quicker if I could just run parts in
        parallel and then one final job to wrap it up.</em
      >”

      Well, good news! Jenkins is here to help! With the
      <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Join+Plugin"
        >Join Plugin</a
      >
      you can do just that. Over on the confluence page it’s got a number of
      examples and fancy flow charts. But the take-away is that if you can
      describe the flow, you can make it happen. But you’re saying “wait, I need
      to pass information around between the jobs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      We’ve got that one covered for you too with the
      <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin"
        >Parameterized Trigger Plugin</a
      >. And here’s the best part, these two can work together! With both
      plugins installed you can follow the steps listed in the Build Parameters
      section of the Join Plugin.
