      Jenkins embarked on an new project, the Jenkins “LTS” (Long Term Support)
      release line. A LTS branch of development is common in most major open
      source projects, especially those with substantial corporate adoption, so
      this was a great step for the project as a whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re now coming up on the second LTS release, which will be an
      incremental update to the previous one (1.409.1) with only the most
      important fixes back-ported to the branch.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Now</strong> is when we need your help.</p>
    <p>
      We need testers and interested parties from the community to help verify
      the stability of the planned LTS update, 1.409.2, which is now in the
      release candidate stages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testing of 1.409.2 has been spearheaded by community member
      <code>vjuranek</code> who has created
      <a
        href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+1.409.x+RC+Testing"
        >this <strong>fantastic test matrix</strong></a
      >
      to help coordinate testing of release candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LTS project is entirely community driven, so your input is invaluable
      in making these releases successful.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="/content/mailing-lists">-dev mailing list</a> and start pitching
      in on the test matrix!
