        >Jenkins community survey result is in</a
      >, which shows a number of interesting stats for us developers, such as
      82% of people saying their Jenkins is mission critical, or the spread of
      distributed builds, especially compared to

      But just as interesting is the free-form answers to questions like “If
      there was anything you could you change about Jenkins CI, what would it
      be?”, and while the answer is colorful, there are a few common themes that
      one can easily spot.

      about this exact topic a week ago.

    <p>
      The idea is to brainstorm what kind of concrete improvements people would
      like to see, then run them through some real user experience designers and
      decide which ones are good ideas and which ones are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find this thread useful — so much so that one of those ideas (always
      show the “Save” button at the bottom in the config page) is already
      implemented toward the next release of Jenkins. So if you have some
      thoughts to share, please chime in on that thread.
