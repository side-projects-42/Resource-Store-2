      Since the end of April, Jenkins has been officially part of the
      <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org">SPI</a> (Software in the Public
      Interest), an umbrella organization which offers a useful level of legal
      status for the project.

    <p>
      Up until recently we had not taken proper advantage of this new legal
      umbrella, thankfully that’s changed as we’re now capable of

        ></strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      For the project this is a big step forward as it will allow us to offset
      the cost of servers for the project, bandwidth, SSL certificates and other
      costs incurred as part of running such a large open source project.

      Since we’re now able to accept donations, we’re kicking off a donation
      drive to help recover some of the costs incurred this summer (<a
        href="/content/mirror-mirror-wall"
        >which I’ve discussed previously</a
      >). Our immediate goal is to raise $5130 to recoup bandwidth costs, if you
      can spare some change, head on over to the
      <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160"
        >SPI online donation page</a
      >
      and help us out :)
