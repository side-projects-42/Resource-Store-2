FAIL __tests__/test.js
  ● Test suite failed to run

    Cannot find module './some-json-file' from 'index.js'

    However, Jest was able to find:
    	'./some-json-file.json'

    You might want to include a file extension in your import, or update your 'moduleFileExtensions', which is currently ['js'].
