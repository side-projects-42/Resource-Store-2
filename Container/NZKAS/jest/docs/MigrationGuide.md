If you’d like to try out Jest with an existing codebase, there are a number of ways to convert to Jest:

- If you are using Jasmine, or a Jasmine like API (for example [Mocha](https://mochajs.org)), Jest should be mostly compatible and easy to migrate to.
- If you are using AVA, Expect.js (by Automattic), Jasmine, Mocha, proxyquire, Should.js or Tape you can automatically migrate with Jest Codemods (see below).
- If you like [chai](http://chaijs.com/), you can upgrade to Jest and continue using chai. However, we recommend trying out Jest’s assertions and their failure messages. Jest Codemods can migrate from chai (see below).

If you are using [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava), [Chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai), [Expect.js (by Automattic)](https://github.com/Automattic/expect.js), [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine), [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), [proxyquire](https://github.com/thlorenz/proxyquire), [Should.js](https://github.com/tj/should.js/) or [Tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) you can use the third-party [jest-codemods](https://github.com/skovhus/jest-codemods) to do most of the dirty migration work. It runs a code transformation on your codebase using [jscodeshift](https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift).

Install Jest Codemods with `yarn` by running:

    yarn global add jest-codemods

To transform your existing tests, navigate to the project containing the tests and run:

    jest-codemods
