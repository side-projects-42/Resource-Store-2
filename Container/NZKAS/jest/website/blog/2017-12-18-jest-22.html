    <p>
      Today we are announcing a new major version of Jest which refines almost
      all parts of Jest to provide a more solid testing foundation. Together
      with the Jest community we made a number of changes across the board that
      will help you get more out of Jest. We are also graduating the custom
      runners feature out of the experimental stage and added a new package,
      <code>jest-worker</code>, for parallelizing work across multiple
      processes. We have compiled a list of highlights below but make sure to
      check out the (as always)
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"
        >massive changelog</a
      >.

    <h2 id="good-bye-node-4-welcome-jsdom-11">
      Good bye Node 4 &amp; welcome JSDOM 11
    </h2>
    <p>
      With this release we are dropping support for Node 4, mainly because one
      of our main dependencies, JSDOM, ended their support. Jest now comes out
      of the box with JSDOM 11 which features better support for SVGs,
      <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>, <code>URL</code> and
      <code>URLSearchParams</code> built in, and
      <a href="https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/blob/master/Changelog.md"
        >much more</a
      >.

    <h2 id="custom-runners-easy-parallelization-with-jest-worker">
      Custom Runners + Easy parallelization with <code>jest-worker</code>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In Jest 21 we introduced the concept of custom Jest runners. Since then,
      Rogelio, one of Jest’s core contributors, built a number of useful
      runners: If you have many existing tests written using another framework
      but you’d like to immediately benefit from Jest’s features, check out
      <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest-runner-mocha"
        >jest-runner-mocha</a
      >. If you have a large codebase that needs linting,
      <a href="https://twitter.com/lencioni/status/907398856756695040"
        >you may get a significant speedup</a
      >
      if you run eslint within Jest using
      <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest-runner-eslint"
        >jest-runner-eslint</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      To gain more of fine-grained control over heavy tasks parallelization
      (e.g. transforming files or crawling the file system), we designed a new
      library perfectly suited for the job. We developed a modern, Promise-based
      module with an approachable API, called <code>jest-worker</code>, that
      allows you to delegate to child processes those intensive functions. As
      <code>jest-worker</code>, like any other Jest package, is a part of the
      Jest platform, you can use it however you like even without ever using
      Jest itself. You’ll find more in the documentation
      <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest-worker">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      To get a better understanding of custom runners and Jest as a platform,
      make sure to check out Rogelio’s talk from Reactive Conf 2017:

      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="codeframe-in-test-failures">Codeframe in test failures</h2>
    <p>
      In order to more easily identify which assertion is failing your test,
      we’ve added a code frame showing the context where the assertion is in
      order to focus on your own code. See the following example test:
    </p>
    <pre><code>test(&#39;some test&#39;, () =&gt; {
  function someFunctionWhichShouldThrow() {
    if (false) {
      throw new Error();
    }

    return &#39;success!&#39;;
  }

  expect(someFunctionWhichShouldThrow).toThrowError();
});</code></pre>
    <p>In Jest 21, we would display the following error:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/img/blog/22-failure-21.png" alt="failure in Jest 21" />
      <figcaption>failure in Jest 21</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      In Jest 22, we have added a codeframe, giving more context to the failing
      assertions. We have also cleaned up the stack trace to remove more clutter
      than ever.

    <h2 id="easier-testing-of-errors-thrown-in-async-code">
      Easier testing of errors thrown in async code
    </h2>
    <p>
      You can now use <code>toThrow</code> and
      <code>toThrowErrorMatchingSnapshot</code> on promise rejections in the
      same way you can on synchronous errors.
    </p>
    <pre><code>async function throwingFunction() {
  throw new Error(&#39;This failed&#39;);
}

test(&#39;asynchronous rejection&#39;, async () =&gt; {
  await expect(throwingFunction()).rejects.toThrowErrorMatchingSnapshot();
});</code></pre>
    <h2 id="asynchronous-test-environments">Asynchronous test environments</h2>
    <p>
      When <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/">Puppeteer</a>, a
      way of programmatically interacting with a real Chromium Browser, was
      announced by the Google Chrome team in August, many wanted to be able to
      use Jest to write their tests running them in Chrome. The community have
      helped us out making this possible by allowing asynchronous test
      environments. We are still working on making this experience as good as
      possible, but please see
      <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer.html">this guide</a> for how
      to use Puppeteer with Jest, starting today.
    </p>
    <h2 id="experimental-leak-detection">Experimental Leak Detection</h2>
    <p>
      We added an experimental <code>--detectLeaks</code> setting to Jest that
      will let you know if your internal environment instance is leaked after a
      test execution. It will also warn you when your test suite tries to
      require a file after the test has finished, meaning you forgot to wait for
      all async operations or left something not properly cleaned. This will
      however not discover leaks in user land code, only in test land code;
      although the technology used behind it can help you (see
      <code>jest-leak-detector</code>). If you are reporting a bug about Jest’s
      memory usage, please provide a repro where <code>--detectLeaks</code> will
      make the test suite fail. We
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/4970"
        >started building a better sandboxing mechanism</a
      >
      for Jest but it’s not ready yet to be enabled by default. If you’d like to
      help, please reach out to us on discord!
    </p>
    <h2 id="watch-mode-refinements">Watch Mode Refinements</h2>
    <p>
      When using watch mode, there is now a way to
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/4886"
        >focus only on tests that previously failed</a
      >. In this mode, Jest will not re-run previously passing tests which
      should help you iron out all test failures. Additionally,
      <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/pull/4841"
        >we added a plugin system to watch mode</a
      >. By adding modules to <code>watchPlugins</code> in your configuration
      you can extend the features of the watch mode.
    </p>
    <h2 id="babel-7-support">Babel 7 support</h2>
    <p>
      Jest uses Babel under the hood to power code coverage and advanced mocking
      features. With Jest 22, it also supports the upcoming Babel 7. You’ll find
      more in the documentation
      <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started.html#using-babel"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h2 id="mock-function-improvements">Mock function improvements</h2>
    <p>
      There has been a couple of changes to mock functions in Jest 22, making
      them even easier to use. Firstly, we added a
      <a
        href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api.html#mockfnmocknamevalue"
        ><code>mockName</code></a
      >
      property allowing you to name your mocks, which is useful in assertion
      failures. We have also made the Jest mock function serializable in
      <code>pretty-format</code>, meaning that you can snapshot test mocks. In
      Jest 21, <code>expect(jest.fn()).toMatchSnapshot()</code> would serialize
      to <code>[Function]</code>, in Jest 22, you might get something like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>test(&#39;my mocking test&#39;, () =&gt; {
  const mock = jest.fn().mockName(&#39;myMock&#39;);

  mock(&#39;hello&#39;, { foo: &#39;bar&#39; });

  expect(mock).toMatchSnapshot();
});

// Serializes to:

[MockFunction myMock] {
  &quot;calls&quot;: Array [
    Array [
      &quot;hello&quot;,
      Object {
        &quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;,
      },
    ],
  ],
}</code></pre>
    <h2 id="highlights-from-jest-21">Highlights from Jest 21</h2>
    <p>
      Jest 21 was released back in September, and we unfortunately never got
      around to write a blog post. So here is a quick summary of the main
      changes in version 21:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <strong>Use expect and jest-mock in the browser:</strong>
        <a href="https://github.com/mjackson">Michael Jackson</a> donated his
        excellent
        <a href="https://github.com/mjackson/expect"><code>expect</code></a>
        package to the Jest project. As part of that transition, the Jest core
        team, with much help from
        <a href="https://github.com/skovhus/">Kenneth Skovhus</a>, made both
        <code>jest-matchers</code> (renamed to <code>expect</code>) and
        <code>jest-mock</code> work in browsers. This means that while you
        cannot use Jest itself in browsers (<a
          href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/848"
          >yet</a
        >), you can use its awesome assertions and mocks for instance as
        replacements for Chai and Sinon running in Mocha tests. If you are
        migrating from earlier <code>expect</code> to the new Jest-powered
        <code>expect</code>, you can use
        <a href="https://github.com/skovhus/jest-codemods/"
          ><code>jest-codemods</code></a
        >
        to automate the migration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>MIT License:</strong> We changed Jest’s license to MIT.
        <em>Yay!</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fail test suites on async errors:</strong> Jest used to have a
        bug that made it crash when errors were thrown in certain parts of async
        code. This was fixed by community contributors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Faster startup:</strong> With Jest 21 we fine tuned Jest’s
        startup to be more than 50% faster. The large overhead of Jest when
        running it on a small and fast test was always an issue for us and now
        this shouldn’t be a reason to hold you back from using Jest any longer.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="jest-community">Jest Community</h2>
    <p>
      The community around Jest is working hard to make the testing experience
      even greater. These are separate projects from the main Jest project, but
      we want to highlight some of our personal favorites here.
    </p>

          >jest-plugins</a
        >
        – a new community project oriented around simplifying setting up test
        environment for specific tools, like React, or providing some handy
        utilities
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We’d also like to announce that recently we launched a new place for high
      quality Jest additions –
      <a href="https://github.com/jest-community">jest-community</a>. It’s a new
      GitHub organization already featuring our favorite projects, like
      <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest">vscode-jest</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended">jest-extended</a
      >, to name a few, curated by Jest maintainers and collaborators. We’ve
      even migrated our
      <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest"
        >eslint-plugin-jest</a
      >
      there, and already see some great contributions, which are published
      independently at a faster pace.

    <p>
      Community projects under one organisation are also a great way for us to
      experiment on things like automated releases, which we’d like to explore
      for Jest as well. They also enable us to share some common things between
      them, like the shape of the README for example (thanks to the webpack
      Community for the idea), making it easier to learn and use for all of us.

      love to share your project here.
