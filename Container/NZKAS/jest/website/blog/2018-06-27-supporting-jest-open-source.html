      Jest is maintained by a community of open source contributors and Facebook
      employees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our open source contributors work on behalf of the community to create new
      features, fix bugs, and maintain the issue backlog. Facebook employees do
      the same, focused on the problems specific to Facebook’s scale, and run
      all proposed releases on Facebook’s enormous test suite before publishing.
    </p>
    <p>All of us do our part to make testing delightful.</p>
    <p>
      At the Jest Summit we announced the Jest Open Collective. This is our way
      to help support the efforts of the open source Jest community.
      <strong
        >To be absolutely clear: Facebook employees cannot benefit from the Jest
        Open Collective.</strong
      >
      The collective’s sole purpose is to support the open source side of the
      Jest community.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this post we’ll outline what the Jest Open Collective is, the
      structure, and the goals we have.

      Open Collective is a platform to manage groups of people transparently.
      Jest joins projects like
      <a href="https://opencollective.com/webpack">Webpack</a>,
      <a href="https://opencollective.com/babel">Babel</a>,
      <a href="https://opencollective.com/mochajs">Mocha</a>,
      <a href="https://opencollective.com/preact">Preact</a>,
      <a href="https://opencollective.com/vuejs">Vue</a>, and many more in
      supporting the open source community through the Open Collective platform.

      What is the Jest Open Collective
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Jest Open Collective is a group of open source contributors who
      operate in full transparency to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Receive funds from backers and sponsors</li>
      <li>Approve expenses submitted by the community</li>
      <li>Give everyone visibility on the budget</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-structure-of-the-collective">
      What is the structure of the collective
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Jest Open Collective is currently managed by three non-Facebook core
      contributors from the open source community:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/thymikee">Michal Pierzchala</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/simenb">Simen Bekkhus</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii">Rick Hanlon</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Michal has been an active Jest contributor since September 2016, Simen
      joined the core team in June 2017, and Rick joined in January. They’re
      responsible for setting the budget, approving expenses, and managing
      admins of the collective. We have elected to keep
      <a href="https://twitter.com/cpojer">Christoph Nakazawa</a> as an adviser.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two levels of support for the collective: Backer and Sponsor.
    </p>
    <h3 id="backers">Backers</h3>
    <p>
      Backers of the collective are individuals contributing at least $2/month.
      We’ll include a list of backers on the Jest homepage, README on
      github/yarn/npm, and Contributors page.
    </p>
    <h3 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h3>
    <p>
      Sponsors of the collective are individuals and organizations contributing
      at least $100/month. We’ll place sponsor logos with a link to their site
      on the Jest homepage, README on github/yarn/npm, and Contributors page.
    </p>
    <h2 id="what-is-the-goal-of-the-collective">
      What is the goal of the collective
    </h2>
    <p>
      The goal of the collective is to support the work of open source
      contributors to Jest in order to make testing delightful.
    </p>
    <p>To achieve that goal, we will use the funds to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cover speaker travel expenses</li>
      <li>Host events and meetups</li>
      <li>Print and distribute swag</li>
      <li>Develop and fund a bug bounty program (TBD)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is just the beginning and we’re committed to getting this right. If
      you have ideas on how else we can support the community, or feedback on
      the structure of the collective, please reach out to us on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/fbjest">twitter</a>!
    </p>
    <h1 id="thank-you">Thank You</h1>
    <p>
      Finally, thank you to everyone who contributes to the Jest community and
      open source in general. We are incredibly grateful that we get the
      opportunity to work on improving JavaScript testing together.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jest core team would also like to make a special thank you to Facebook
      Open Source for driving the creation of this collective.
