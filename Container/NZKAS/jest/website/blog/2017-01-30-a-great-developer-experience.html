      We strongly believe that great documentation is crucial to providing a
      great developer experience. The docs should be clear, concise, and useful
      to new users and veterans alike. With that in mind, we recently took some
      time to overhaul the Jest website.
    </p>
    <h2 id="improved-docs">Improved docs</h2>
    <p>
      One of the changes you’ll notice upon visiting our docs is the updated
      sidebar. The documentation is now divided into three main areas: an
      introduction to Jest, detailed guides to Jest’s features, and a
      comprehensive API reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>Introduction</strong> section will guide you from installing
      Jest and writing your first case, to using Jest’s matchers and testing
      async code. If you’re new to Jest or need a quick refresher, these docs
      should get you up to speed in no time. If you’ve used Jest before and only
      need a quick reference on how it’s installed, you need to go no further
      than the <a href="/docs/getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you feel comfortable using Jest, proceed to the advanced
      <strong>Guides</strong> section. The new
      <a href="/docs/snapshot-testing.html">Snapshot Testing guide</a> covers
      everything you need to know about creating and maintaining snapshot test
      cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, we’ve completely overhauled our API reference docs. You can now
      find detailed information on all of Jest’s
      <a href="/docs/api.html">Globals</a>,
      <a href="/docs/expect.html">matchers</a>, and
      <a href="/docs/cli.html">every flag</a> supported by the
      <code>jest</code> CLI.
    </p>
    <!--truncate-->
    <h2 id="new-colors-website">New colors &amp; website</h2>
    <p>
      The colors in the Jest logo and on the website have felt outdated to us
      for a while. We changed the color scheme we are using for Jest and changed
      the landing page significantly to be more inviting. We hope you like the
      new colors and showcase of Jest’s strengths.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whos-using-jest">Who’s using Jest?</h2>
    <p>
      We have created a <a href="/users.html">showcase of users</a> to highlight
      some of the companies that are using Jest. We’re thankful to all of these
      companies for using Jest to test their websites, mobile apps, and APIs. If
      you’re using Jest, check out the guidelines on GitHub and send us a pull
      request!

    <h2 id="jest-in-the-browser">Jest in the browser</h2>
    <p>
      As highlighted
      <a href="/blog/2016/12/15/2016-in-jest.html">last month</a>, it is now
      possible to use Jest directly in the browser using
      <a href="https://repl.it/languages/jest">repl.it</a>. If you want to try
      out Jest before installing it, you can easily do so below or directly from
      the Jest homepage. Go ahead and give it a try!

      This is just the start. Go ahead and take a look at the docs, and don’t
      hesitate to send any feedback our way. If you find a mistake in the docs
      or you just want to let us know what needs to be documented better, please
