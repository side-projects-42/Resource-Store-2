    <p>
      The community around Jest is working hard to make the testing experience
      even greater.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/jest-community">jest-community</a> is a new
      GitHub organization for high quality Jest additions curated by Jest
      maintainers and collaborators. It already features some of our favorite
      projects, to name a few:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest">vscode-jest</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended"
          >jest-extended</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest"
          >eslint-plugin-jest</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest"
          >awesome-jest</a
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Community projects under one organisation are a great way for Jest to
      experiment with new ideas/techniques and approaches. Encourage
      contributions from the community and publish contributions independently
      at a faster pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jest-community org maintains an
      <a href="https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest">awesome-jest</a>
      list of great projects and resources related to Jest, this includes all
      projects not just the ones in the jest-community org.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have something awesome to share, feel free to reach out to us! Weâ€™d
      love to share your project on the awesome-jest list (<a
        href="https://github.com/jest-community/awesome-jest/pulls"
        >send a PR here</a
      >) or if you would like to transfer your project to the jest-community org
      reachout to one of the owners of the org.
