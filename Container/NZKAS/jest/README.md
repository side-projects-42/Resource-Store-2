# üÉè Delightful JavaScript Testing

**üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Developer Ready**: A comprehensive JavaScript testing solution. Works out of the box for most JavaScript projects.

**üèÉüèΩ Instant Feedback**: Fast, interactive watch mode only runs test files related to changed files.

**üì∏ Snapshot Testing**: Capture snapshots of large objects to simplify testing and to analyze how they change over time.

## Getting Started

Install Jest using [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/jest):

    yarn add --dev jest

Or [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/):

    npm install --save-dev jest

Note: Jest documentation uses `yarn` commands, but `npm` will also work. You can compare `yarn` and `npm` commands in the [yarn docs, here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/migrating-from-npm#toc-cli-commands-comparison).

Let‚Äôs get started by writing a test for a hypothetical function that adds two numbers. First, create a `sum.js` file:

    function sum(a, b) {
      return a + b;
    }
    module.exports = sum;

Then, create a file named `sum.test.js`. This will contain our actual test:

    const sum = require('./sum');

    test('adds 1 + 2 to equal 3', () => {
      expect(sum(1, 2)).toBe(3);
    });

Add the following section to your `package.json`:

    {
      "scripts": {
        "test": "jest"
      }
    }

Finally, run `yarn test` or `npm run test` and Jest will print this message:

    PASS  ./sum.test.js
    ‚úì adds 1 + 2 to equal 3 (5ms)

**You just successfully wrote your first test using Jest!**

This test used `expect` and `toBe` to test that two values were exactly identical. To learn about the other things that Jest can test, see [Using Matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/using-matchers).

## Running from command line

You can run Jest directly from the CLI (if it‚Äôs globally available in your `PATH`, e.g.¬†by `yarn global add jest` or `npm install jest --global`) with a variety of useful options.

Here‚Äôs how to run Jest on files matching `my-test`, using `config.json` as a configuration file and display a native OS notification after the run:

    jest my-test --notify --config=config.json

If you‚Äôd like to learn more about running `jest` through the command line, take a look at the [Jest CLI Options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli) page.

## Additional Configuration

### Generate a basic configuration file

Based on your project, Jest will ask you a few questions and will create a basic configuration file with a short description for each option:

    jest --init

### Using Babel

To use [Babel](http://babeljs.io/), install required dependencies via `yarn`:

    yarn add --dev babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env

If you do not already have babel configured for your project, you can use Babel to target your current version of Node by creating a `babel.config.js` file in the root of your project:

    // babel.config.js
    module.exports = {
      presets: [['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}]],
    };

_The ideal configuration for Babel will depend on your project._ See [Babel‚Äôs docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/) for more details.

**Making your Babel config jest-aware**

Jest will set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `'test'` if it‚Äôs not set to something else. You can use that in your configuration to conditionally setup only the compilation needed for Jest, e.g.

    // babel.config.js
    module.exports = (api) => {
      const isTest = api.env('test');
      // You can use isTest to determine what presets and plugins to use.

      return {
        // ...
      };
    };

> Note: `babel-jest` is automatically installed when installing Jest and will automatically transform files if a babel configuration exists in your project. To avoid this behavior, you can explicitly reset the `transform` configuration option:

    // jest.config.js
    module.exports = {
      transform: {},
    };

### Using webpack

Jest can be used in projects that use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) to manage assets, styles, and compilation. webpack does offer some unique challenges over other tools. Refer to the [webpack guide](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/webpack) to get started.

### Using TypeScript

Jest supports TypeScript, via Babel. First make sure you followed the instructions on [using Babel](#using-babel) above. Next install the `@babel/preset-typescript` via `yarn`:

    yarn add --dev @babel/preset-typescript

Then add `@babel/preset-typescript` to the list of presets in your `babel.config.js`.

    // babel.config.js
    module.exports = {
      presets: [
        ['@babel/preset-env', {targets: {node: 'current'}}],
    +    '@babel/preset-typescript',
      ],
    };

Note, there are some [caveats](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-transform-typescript.html#caveats) to using TypeScript with Babel. Because TypeScript support in Babel is just transpilation, Jest will not type-check your tests as they are ran. If you want that, you can use [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest).
