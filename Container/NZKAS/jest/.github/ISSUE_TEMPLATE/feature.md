## Pitch

Why does this feature belong in the [Jest core platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtjyeojAOBs)?

Common feature proposals that do not typically make it to core:

- New matchers (see [jest-extended](https://github.com/jest-community/jest-extended))
- Changes to the default reporter (use custom reporters instead)
- Changes to node/jsdom test environments (use custom environments instead)
