Quickstart
----------

If you are using Maven, add this to your pom.xml file (notice that you can replace `google-auth-library-oauth2-http` with any of `google-auth-library-credentials` and `google-auth-library-appengine`, depending on your application needs):

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.auth</groupId>
      <artifactId>google-auth-library-oauth2-http</artifactId>
      <version>0.16.2</version>
    </dependency>

If you are using Gradle, add this to your dependencies

    compile 'com.google.auth:google-auth-library-credentials:0.16.2'

If you are using SBT, add this to your dependencies

    libraryDependencies += "com.google.auth" % "google-auth-library-credentials" % "0.16.2"

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.auth</groupId>
      <artifactId>google-auth-library-credentials</artifactId>
      <version>0.16.2</version>
    </dependency>

If you are using Gradle, add this to your dependencies

    compile 'com.google.auth:google-auth-library-credentials:0.16.2'

If you are using SBT, add this to your dependencies

    libraryDependencies += "com.google.auth" % "google-auth-library-credentials" % "0.16.2"
