      This is the thing that updates the “node in the industry” section on the
      node homepage, by picking 4 items at random.
    </p>
    <h2 id="hey-we-use-node-can-i-get-my-company-on-here">
      Hey! We use node! Can I get my company on here?
    </h2>
    <p>Probably!</p>
    <p>
      Send your request in the form of a pull request. It must add a folder at
      <code>data/&lt;mycompany&gt;</code> (where
      <code>&lt;mycompany&gt;</code> is the name of your company), containing a
      <code>quote.html</code> file and a <code>logo.png</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>quote.html</code> file should be just like the others: about 20
      words explaining why node is a good fit at your company, from a technical
      leader at your company, with a link to an appropriate page, preferrably
      containing more info about your use of node. Longer quotes may be
      truncated or exerpted or rejected, at Joyent’s sole discretion. The HTML
      markup in the quote.html may be modified if necessary, at the sole
      discretion of Joyent and the Node.js Project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>logo.png</code> file MUST be 68px tall, and no more than 340px
      wide. (This is double the size on the page. It’ll be resized down for the
      benefit of retina displays.) It should be JUST your official company logo
      and the (R) or (TM) symbol, in a single color:
      <code>rgb(210,216,186)</code> on <code>rgb(51,52,45)</code>, with
      appropriate antialiasing. It MUST NOT contain any additional texture,
      taglines, highlighting. It may be edited to better accomodate the needs of
      the web page design, or for any other reason, at the sole discretion of
      Joyent and the Node.js Project.
    </p>
    <p>You can test your addition by running the following bash command:</p>
    <pre><code>NOSHUFFLE=1 bash make-index.sh</code></pre>
    <p>and then open the <code>index.html</code> file in your web browser.</p>
    <p>
      By submitting this request, you are giving Joyent, Inc. permission to use
      the supplied logo on the “Node.js in the Industry” section of the
      nodejs.org homepage, and to make any such modifications as Joyent deems
      necessary or appropriate for the context. Joyent is not obligated to
      include your company logo and link on the nodejs.org home page, and will
      do so at the sole discretion of Joyent and the Node.js Project.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you would like it removed, simply send a pull request removing it from
      the git repository, and it will be removed from the site promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      No other relationship between your company and Joyent is implied or
      required.
