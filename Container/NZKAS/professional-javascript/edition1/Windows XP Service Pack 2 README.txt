If you are using Internet Explorer on Windows XP Service Pack 2, there is a security restriction disallowing scripts to run in files opened on your local machine. When you first try to run the examples, you will most likely get a message saying, "To help protect your security, Internet Explorer has restricted this file from showing active content that could access your computer." To see the example, you must click on the message and select "Allow Blocked Content".
