        <p>In this example, the <code>var</code> statement isn't used to define
        the variable <code>sMyFirstName</code>, so it is created as a variable
        at the <code>window</code> scope. This is proved because the second function
        can also access the variable and display it in an alert.</p>
        <script type="text/javascript">

            function sayFirstName() {
                sMyFirstName = "Nicholas";
                alert(sMyFirstName);
            }
            
            function sayFirstNameToo() {
                alert(sMyFirstName);
            }
            
            sayFirstName();
            sayFirstNameToo();
        </script>
