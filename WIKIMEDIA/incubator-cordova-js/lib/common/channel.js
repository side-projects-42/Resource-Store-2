/**
 * Custom pub-sub "channel" that can have functions subscribed to it
 * This object is used to define and control firing of events for
 * cordova initialization.
 *
 * The order of events during page load and Cordova startup is as follows:
 *
 * onDOMContentLoaded         Internal event that is received when the web page is loaded and parsed.
 * onNativeReady              Internal event that indicates the Cordova native side is ready.
 * onCordovaReady             Internal event fired when all Cordova JavaScript objects have been created.
 * onCordovaInfoReady         Internal event fired when device properties are available.
 * onCordovaConnectionReady   Internal event fired when the connection property has been set.
 * onDeviceReady              User event fired to indicate that Cordova is ready
 * onResume                   User event fired to indicate a start/resume lifecycle event
 * onPause                    User event fired to indicate a pause lifecycle event
 * onDestroy                  Internal event fired when app is being destroyed (User should use window.onunload event, not this one).
 *
 * The only Cordova events that user code should register for are:
 *      deviceready           Cordova native code is initialized and Cordova APIs can be called from JavaScript
 *      pause                 App has moved to background
 *      resume                App has returned to foreground
 *
 * Listeners can be registered as:
 *      document.addEventListener("deviceready", myDeviceReadyListener, false);
 *      document.addEventListener("resume", myResumeListener, false);
 *      document.addEventListener("pause", myPauseListener, false);
 *
 * The DOM lifecycle events should be used for saving and restoring state
 *      window.onload
 *      window.onunload
 *
