<p>This directory contains data files for testing XML dumps. Each file contains an XML structure, full or partial. These data files are intended to be used with DumpAsserter::assertDOM().</p>
<p>The data files contain XML with variable placeholders using a mustache-like syntax, e.g.Â {{site_name}}. The variable placeholder syntax is implemented by DumpAsserter::resolveVars(), variable values can be defined using DumpAsserter::setVarMapping(). Any differences in whitespace and any comments in the XML files are ignored.</p>
<p>Data files may make use of the <test:data> and <test:end/> tags: <test:data> acts as a wrapper for a sequence of elements and is ignored during comparison. <test:end/> terminates the comparison, and causes all subsequent content of the file to be ignored. The behavior of the <test:data> and <test:end/> tags is controlled by DumpAsserter::assertDOM().</p>
<p>The names of these files, the data they contain, as well as the names of the variables used, are determined by the PageDumpTestDataTrait, which is a trait used by some of the subclasses of DumpTestCase.</p>
