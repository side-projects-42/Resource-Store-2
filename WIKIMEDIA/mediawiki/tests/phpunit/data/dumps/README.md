This directory contains data files for testing XML dumps. Each file contains an XML structure, full or partial. These data files are intended to be used with DumpAsserter::assertDOM().

The data files contain XML with variable placeholders using a mustache-like syntax, e.g.Â {{site\_name}}. The variable placeholder syntax is implemented by DumpAsserter::resolveVars(), variable values can be defined using DumpAsserter::setVarMapping(). Any differences in whitespace and any comments in the XML files are ignored.

Data files may make use of the and tags: acts as a wrapper for a sequence of elements and is ignored during comparison. terminates the comparison, and causes all subsequent content of the file to be ignored. The behavior of the and tags is controlled by DumpAsserter::assertDOM().

The names of these files, the data they contain, as well as the names of the variables used, are determined by the PageDumpTestDataTrait, which is a trait used by some of the subclasses of DumpTestCase.
