Thanks for installing Cordova {VERSION}!
----------------------------------------

Plugins
-------

-   **DO NOT CHECK** the “Automatic Reference Counting” option when creating a new project, if not you will have compile errors.
-   Plugins **MUST** add their plugin mapping to their app’s Cordova.plist Plugins key, if not they will not work (see your plugin’s README)
-   Plugins **MUST** add any external hosts they connect to to the white-list in Cordova.plist/ExternalHosts (add hostnames **only**, NO protocols nor paths)
-   A plugin’s Objective-C code **MUST** be added to the project properly in a “group” (**YELLOW** folder), if you incorrectly added it as a folder reference it would be a blue folder (just delete the reference, and re-add)
-   A lot of plugins have changed their mapping names in Cordova.plist, you might have to copy and use the new Cordova.plist in your app.

Creating a new Cordova-based project

Follow the instructions in the [**Command-Line Usage** section](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/guide_command-line_index.md.html#Command-Line%20Usage) of <http://docs.phonegap.com>

That’s it! Modify the contents of the “www” directory to add your HTML, CSS and Javascript.
