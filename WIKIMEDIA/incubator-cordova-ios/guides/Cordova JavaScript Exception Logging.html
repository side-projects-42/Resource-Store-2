<h1 id="cordova-javascript-exception-logging">Cordova JavaScript Exception Logging</h1>
<p>In Cordova 1.7.0, adding a few files to your project will enable you to effectively log JavaScript errors to your console at a lower level, without using JavaScript code (window.onerror, console.log).</p>
<p>NOTE: when you include these files, it will <strong>always pop up a warning dialog at startup</strong>, to remind you that you have these classes included. This is to prevent you from inadvertently shipping this code for the App Store, where this code is not allowed (it uses a private interface).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install <strong>Cordova 1.7.0</strong></li>
<li>In your app, add the whole <strong>debugview</strong> folder from <strong>~/Documents/CordovaLib/Classes/debugview</strong> (where ~ signifies your Home folder). Make sure you select the radiobutton - <strong>“Create groups for any added folders”</strong></li>
<li><p>In your app’s <strong>MainViewController.m</strong>, uncomment/add this code:</p>
<pre><code>- (CDVCordovaView*) newCordovaViewWithFrame:(CGRect)bounds
{
    return [[CDVDebugWebView alloc] initWithFrame:bounds];
}</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Don’t forget to add the import at the top of your <strong>MainViewController.m</strong> file as well:</p>
<pre><code>#import &quot;CDVDebugWebView.h&quot;</code></pre></li>
</ol>
