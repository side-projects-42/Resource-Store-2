<h1 id="cordova-settings-file">Cordova Settings File</h1>
<p>The <strong>Cordova.plist settings file</strong> controls various settings of Cordova. This is application wide, and not set per CDVViewController instance.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A list of <strong>Plugins</strong> allowed to be used in a CDVViewController (set in the Plugins dictionary - key is the servicename used in JavaScript, and the value is the Objective-C class for the plugin that is a CDVPlugin sub-class)</li>
<li>A <strong>white-list</strong> of hosts (with no scheme nor path, hostnames or IP addresses only) that Cordova is allowed to connect to (set in the ExternalHosts array - wildcards allowed)</li>
<li><p>Various <strong>other</strong> settings (defaults err on not breaking existing apps)</p>
<ol type="a">
<li><p><strong>UIWebViewBounce (boolean, defaults to YES)</strong> - set to NO if you don’t want the WebView to rubber-band</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TopActivityIndicator (string, defaults to ‘gray’)</strong> - this is the top spinning throbber in the status/battery bar, valid values are “whiteLarge”, “white” and “gray”</p></li>
<li><p><strong>EnableLocation (boolean, defaults to NO)</strong> - set to YES, to initialize the Geolocation plugin at start-up (so the fix on your location can be more accurate)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>EnableViewportScale (boolean, defaults to NO)</strong> - set to YES to prevent viewport scaling through a meta tag</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AutoHideSplashScreen (boolean, defaults to YES)</strong> - set to NO to control when the splashscreen is hidden through a JavaScript API</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ShowSplashScreenSpinner (boolean, defaults to YES)</strong> - set to NO to hide the splash-screen spinner</p></li>
<li><p><strong>MediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction (boolean, defaults to NO)</strong> - set to YES to not allow autoplayed HTML5 video</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AllowInlineMediaPlayback (boolean, defaults to NO)</strong> - set to YES to allow inline HTML5 media playback, also, the video element in the HTML document must also include the webkit-playsinline attribute</p></li>
<li><p><strong>OpenAllWhitelistURLsInWebView (boolean, defaults to NO)</strong> - set to YES to open all white-listed URLs in the main WebView</p></li>
<li><p><strong>BackupWebStorage (boolean, defaults to YES)</strong> - set to NO to prevent the backup of localStorage and WebSQL databases to the Documents/Backups folder. This was a fix for this <a href="http://phonegap.com/2012/04/18/ios-5-1-and-the-embedded-uiwebview-with-cordova/">Apple bug</a></p></li>
