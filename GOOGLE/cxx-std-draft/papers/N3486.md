-   fixed typo
-   \[thread.condition.condvar\] Consistently use system\_error instead of std::system\_error. Thanks to Masayoshi Kanke!
-   \[meta.rel\] Fix a Clause reference. Thanks to Masayoshi Kanke!
-   Fix a few more Clause references.
-   \[dcl.fct\] Add missing semicolon to declaration statement in p12. Thanks to Masayoshi Kanke!
-   \[dcl.type\] Refer to a clause with “Clause”. Thanks to Masayoshi Kanke!
-   \[basic.type.qualifier\] Reference correct section for alignment requirements. Thanks to Masayoshi Kanke!
-   \[basic.link\] Fix reference to clause to include “Clause”. Thanks to Masayoshi Kanke!
-   \[basic.lookup.elab\] Fix indentation of comment. Thanks to Masayoshi Kanke!

-   Fix &gt;&gt; appearing as guillemets in inline code in a bunch of places.
-   \[basic.fundamental\] Reference &lt;cstdint&gt; instead of &lt;stdint.h&gt; when talking about uint\_least16\_t and uint\_least32\_t. Thanks to Peter Sommerlad!
-   \[diff.library\] Fix typo USRT\_MAX -&gt; USHRT\_MAX. Thanks to Kevin McCarty!
-   Index: fix location of &lt;scoped\_allocator&gt; entry in index.
-   \[stream.iterators\] Replace reference to non-existent “partial\_sum\_copy” with “partial\_sum” in example. Thanks to Peter Sommerlad!
-   Remove a bunch of “is guaranteed” and “encouraged, but not required” and replace them with “shall” and “should”.
-   \[intro.multithread\] Clarify read-write coherence to make it clear the the operation “B” modifies M. Thanks to Daniel Krügler!
-   \[conversions\] Fix formatting issues, extraneous template arguments to the class Codecvt, reference to codecvt\_utf8 as a user type (when it’s in fact a standard type) in non-normative note and typedef descriptions to match synopsis. Thanks to Jonathan Wakely!

Many (mostly harmless but ugly) extraneous spaces in code blocks containing italicized terms are now gone.

-   \[thread.condition.condvar\] Replace references to timed\_wait. Thanks to Jonathan Wakely!
-   \[streambuf\] Fix typo and typeface in \[streambuf.virt.pback\], add missing itemdescr commands in \[streambuf.virt.put\]. Thanks to Jonathan Wakely!

-   \[namespace.memdef\] Fix “defined” -&gt; “declared” in paragraph 3 code example. Thanks to Mike Miller.
-   \[dcl.dcl\]/3 Don’t italicize the trailing “s” in “class-names”, “enum-names”, or “enumerators”. Thanks to Mike Miller.
-   \[stmt.for\] Fix capitalization of “clause”. Thanks to Mike Miller.
-   \[expr.cond\] Fix indentation of text at the end of /3 that was meant to apply to the paragraph, not the third item of the contained bullet. Thanks to Mike Miller!
-   \[basic.stc.dynamic.allocation\] Use the term “exception object” instead of long description of the same thing. Thanks to Mike Miller.
-   \[basic.scope.class\] Fix grammar issues in last bullet of paragraph 1. Thanks to Mike Miller.
-   \[lex.name\] Fix capitalization. Thanks to Mike Miller.
-   \[reverse.iterator\] and \[reverse.iter.opdiff\]: Fix return type of operator-() to not use protected member in decltype(). Thanks to Daniel Krügler!
