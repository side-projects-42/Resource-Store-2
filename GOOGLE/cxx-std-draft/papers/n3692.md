Confirmed with Mike Miller that the end state should be “…shall not denote an incomplete type or an rvalue reference type.” in the relevant sentence.

    Added a comma after “e.g.” - typo in proposed resolution.

#### <span id="cwgpapers">CWG Papers Applied</span>

Proposed wording from the following CWG papers was applied:

-   [N3472](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2012/n3472) Binary Literals in the C++ Core Language Appendix A (grammar summary) also updated.

-   [N3624](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3624) Pointer comparison vs qualification conversions In the additions to \[expr\], terms like T1, C1, etc., were typeset in code font.

    “pointers to member” was replaced by “pointers to members” in accordance with existing practice in the standard.

    In the new paragraph at the end of \[expr\], the reference to “expr.qual” was fixed to refer to “conv.qual”.

    operator== and operator!= in body text were changed to “the == operator” and “the != operator” respectively. This makes it clear that we are not talking about overloaded operators here.

-   [N3639](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3639) Runtime-sized arrays with automatic storage duration In \[dcl.array\]/1, removed bullet points from the last part of the major bits of added text. The bulleted list was preceded by nothing and appeared out of nowhere.

    Added an index entry for “array of runtime bound” and “runtime bound, array of”.

    In \[support.dynamic\], bad\_array\_length also added to &lt;new&gt; synopsis.

    Typeset types in comments to \[dcl.array\]/1 as code, including two existing instances not added by the paper.

    Improved grammar as follows: “is invoked … after the lifetime of the array ended” -&gt; “… has ended”

    Rearranged commas in \[dcl.fct\]/8 for consistent and correct grammar.

-   [N3648](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3648) Wording Changes for Generalized Lambda-capture Grammar reference updated.

-   [N3653](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3653) Member initializers and aggregates
-   [N3664](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3664) Clarifying Memory Allocation “size parameter” changed to “size argument” in reference to an allocation function.

-   [N3667](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3667) Drafting for Core 1402
-   [N3651](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3651) Variable Templates (Revision 1) The example requested by change set 6 was merged into the existing example for that paragraph.

    The order of “class/function/variable” was kept consistent in applying change 8 in \[temp.inst\].

    I struck “member function” from the added sentence “If the explicit instantiation is for a variable or member function, the unqualified-id in the declaration shall be a template-id.” because that case was already covered in the existing text.

    I reordered the appearance of “variable template” to make it consistent with the rest of the section in a few paragraphs.

    I formatted “const” in “const variables” as fixed-width.

    I added a missing “a” to “has constexpr specifier” in the existing text.

    I changed “template&lt;typename T&gt;” to “template&lt;class T&gt;” for consistency with existing examples in the clause.

-   [N3638](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3638) Return type deduction for normal functions The grammar reference was updated.

    N3638 was based off an earlier draft than N3485. This caused some conflicts in the middle of the \[dcl.spec.auto\] changes. These were resolved based on feedback from the paper author.

    Replaced dangling non-normative sentence referring to \[dcl.spec.auto\] from \[dcl.type.simple\] with a non-normative note to make the paragraph easier to read.

    Avoided sentence starting with a conjunction (“But once a return …”) and instead use “…, however, …”.

    Removed single quotation marks from “instantiates both ’f’s”.

-   [N3649](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3649) Generic (Polymorphic) Lambda Expressions (Revision 3) Because of conflicts with N3638, I had to change the \[dcl.spec.auto\] changes quite a bit, and I recommend CWG create an issue to review the merged state.

    In the example provided (f1, f2, g, h, glambda), it is not clear to me what “ID” refers to in comments like “error: ID is not convertible”.

    Removed code font from “const” and “inline” in sentence usage, e.g. in “For a generic lambda, the closure type has a public inline function”. An editorial issue was opened to make this consistent throughout the draft.

-   [N3652](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3652) Relaxing constraints on constexpr functions Conflicts resolved as indicated by N3652.

    In \[class.copy\]/26 replaced “copy/move each direct base class” with “copy/move each direct base class subobject” to make wording consistent with other section above, as suggested by CWG chair.

#### <span id="lwgissues">LWG Issues Applied</span>

Resolutions from the following LWG issues were applied:

-   [LWG2091](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3522.html#2091) Misplaced effect in m.try\_lock\_for()
-   [LWG2092](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3522.html#2092) Vague Wording for condition\_variable\_any This change was made in \[thread.condition.condvar\] as the context and issue description would suggest, rather than \[thread.timedmutex.requirements\] as the proposed wording indicates (presumably a copy-o from issue 2091).

-   [LWG2145](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3522.html#2145) error\_category default constructor

-   [LWG2175](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3522.html#2175) wstring\_convert and wbuffer\_convert validity Improved the grammar of the first added sentence with a comma.

-   [LWG2177](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3522.html#2177) Requirements on Copy/MoveInsertable I rephrased the new wording for grammar and clarity. Specifically, I replaced “when evaluated the following postconditions hold” with “its evaluation causes the following postcondition to hold” and I changed “satisfying the MoveInsertable requirements” to “T being MoveInsertable into X”.

-   [LWG2187](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3522.html#2187) vector is missing emplace and emplace\_back member functions

    I introduced the term “timeout-related exceptions” to make it clear what is referred to by that phrase later on.

    I dropped “any” from “any timeout-related exceptions” in some of the Throws clauses modified to by the proposed wording to be consistent with the other Throws clauses.

#### <span id="lwgpapers">LWG Papers Applied</span>

Proposed wording from the following LWG papers was applied:

-   [N3668](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3668) exchange() utility function, revision 3
-   [N3545](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3545) An Incremental Improvement to integral\_constant

-   [N3658](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3658) Compile-time integer sequences Includes editorial change to simplify example with return type deduction (as discussed by LWG) as allowed by N3638.

    Updated the overview table in \[utilities.general\].

-   [N3670](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3670) Wording for Addressing Tuples by Type: Revision 2
-   [N3671](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3671) Making non-modifying sequence operations more robust: Revision 2
-   [N3656](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3656) make\_unique (Revision 1) The new overloads were also added to the synopsis.

    Whitespace was tweaked to match the surrounding text.

-   [N3654](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3654) Quoted Strings Library Proposal (Revision 2)
-   [N3642](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3642) User-defined Literals for Standard Library Types (part 1 - version 4) Re-ordered the basic\_string literals so they are listed in the order char, char16\_t, char32\_t and wchar\_t. This matches the other functions in Clause 21.

    Changed const char \*str to const char\* str for consistency with asterisk placement in basic\_string itself.

    Changed operator"" to operator "" for consistency with core wording.

    Added whitespace to duration literal declarations so they are aligned

    Changed section title to “Suffixes for duration literals” instead of “Suffix for duration literals”

    Use string, u16string etc. typedefs for basic\_string

-   [N3657](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3657) Adding heterogeneous comparison lookup to associative containers (rev 4)
-   [N3672](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3672) A proposal to add a utility class to represent optional objects (Revision 4) Updated the overview table in \[utilities.general\].

    Placed after compile-time integer sequences.

    Reorganized \[optional.defs\]/1 as an itemized list.

    Reworded \[optional.object\]/2.

    Reworded \[optional.object.ctor\]/2.

    Added constexpr specifier to constructor declarations to match synopsis and Remarks.

    Corrected \[optional.object.observe\]/18 to depend on both constructors.

    Capitalized first letter of Remarks for operator bool().

-   [N3669](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3669) Fixing constexpr member functions without const
-   [N3662](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3662) C++ Dynamic Arrays Placed between deque and forward\_list, as opposed to at the very end of \[sequences\].

    Removed Allocator template parameter from comparison operators.

    Used ‘template &lt;class T&gt;’ instead of ‘template&lt; typename T &gt;’.

    Declared member types public.

    Referred to 23.2 for implementation-defined iterator types.

    Added ‘explicit’ keyword to first declaration in \[dynarray.cons\].

-   [N3655](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3655) TransformationTraits Redux, v2 Section 4 of the proposal was not applied, as per the LWG motion.

    The added text was interspersed with the corresponding groups of type declarations.
