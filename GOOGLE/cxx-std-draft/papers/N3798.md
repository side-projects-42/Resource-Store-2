In applying CWG1417, a word missing in the proposed wording was added: “if the function type cv-qualifiers …” should have been “if the function type **has** cv-qualifiers …”.

In applying CWG1575, the word “stotate” was corrected to “storage”.

#### <span id="cwgpapers">CWG Papers Applied</span>

Wording from the following CWG papers were applied, with editorial changes as noted:

-   [N3760](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3760.html), \[\[deprecated\]\] attribute
-   [N3781](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3781.html), Single-Quotation-Mark as a Digit Separator
    -   In \[lex.fcon\]/1 I moved the sentence explaining that digit separators are ignored to right before its corresponding example, so that the paragraph still starts with an explanation of what a floating literal consists of.
    -   In \[diff.cpp11.lex\] I reformatted the code example slightly.
-   [N3778](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3778.html), C++ Sized Deallocation
    -   In \[expr.delete\]/9 I included the (not highlighted as being added) wording starting with “Otherwise” as it seemed to be intended to be added to complete the paragraph.
    -   In \[new.delete.array\]/13 I changed the signatures to drop the nothrow\_t parameter in this paragraph as this section deals with throwing array deallocation functions, not non-throwing ones.
    -   In \[diff.cpp11.basic\] I added a reference to \[basic.stc.dynamic.deallocation\] for the change description. I reworded the Effect paragraph to match other change descriptions. I fixed the reference to “new.expr” to instead refer to “expr.new”.

#### <span id="lwgissues">LWG Issues Applied</span>

Resolutions from the following LWG issues were applied: [2141](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2141) [2246](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2246) [2247](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2247) [2085](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2085) [2087](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2087) [2143](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2143) [2150](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2150) [2180](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2180) [2194](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3754.html#2194) [2013](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2013) [2018](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2018) [2078](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2078) [2097](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2097) [2100](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2100) [2120](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2120) [2159](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2159) [2275](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2275) [2284](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2284) [2298](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2298) [2300](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/N3788.html#2300)

In addition to the above issues, I applied the suggested resolutions from NB comments GB-7, ES-15, and GB-9.

I was directed to apply the resolution to LWG issue 2235, but it had already been applied in the post-Bristol working draft.

In applying LWG2298, the second change was in fact in \[meta.rel\] rather than \[meta.unary.prop\]

In applying LWG2018, I moved the note that the function protoype is exposition only to its declaration.

In applying LWG2141, I used the `decay_t<T>` form of decay instead of `typename decay<T>::type`.

Wording from the following LWG papers were applied, with editorial changes as noted:

    -   The title for \[complex.literals\] was changed from “Suffix for…” to “Suffixes for…”.
    -   The first paragraph’s second sentence was reordered slightly to avoid an ambiguity.
