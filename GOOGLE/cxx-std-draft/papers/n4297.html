<h3 id="notable-changes-to-issues-and-papers-as-moved">Notable Changes to Issues and Papers as Moved</h3>
<h4 id="cwg-motion-1">CWG motion 1</h4>
<p>CWG1875, which was in ‘ready’ status in N4192, was neither listed as an issue to be applied nor as an issue to be skipped. Its resolution has not been applied here, and it will once again be in ‘ready’ status for the next meeting.</p>
<p>CWG1651 and CWG1893, which were listed as being applied by this motion, are not applied, because their wording is in CWG1299 which is not being applied. Those issues will be in ‘drafting’ status along with CWG1299 at the next meeting.</p>
<p>CWG1777 has no effect, because its changes are entirely superseded by CWG motion 12.</p>
<h4 id="cwg-motion-5">CWG motion 5</h4>
<p>Update example in [except.throw]p7 to use <code>std::uncaught_exceptions</code> rather than the now-deprecated <code>std::uncaught_exception</code>.</p>
<h4 id="cwg-motion-12">CWG motion 12</h4>
<p>This change conflicts with several other changes moved at Urbana. These conflicts are resolved as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>CWG1351, CWG1552, and CWG1397 introduced new uses of the term <em>exception-specification</em> that refer to the semantic entity rather than the grammar term. These have been fixed where appropriate. Likewise, cross-references for newly-introduced references to <em>throw-expression</em> have been changed from [except.throw] to [expr.throw].</p></li>
<li><p>CWG1777 changed wording that was removed and replaced by this change. The new wording from this change carries the intent of CWG1777 so the edits from CWG1777 have been ignored.</p></li>
<li><p>CWG1351 adds wording to map between exception specifications and “sets of potential exceptions”. This wording has been updated to match the new defintion and semantics of exception specifications, after consultation with CWG.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The change from “<em>exception-specification</em>” to “exception specification” in [dcl.fct.def.default]p3 has not been applied, because this wording clearly intends to refer to the grammar element.</p>
<h4 id="cwg-motion-13">CWG motion 13</h4>
<p>Fix left-fold/right-fold mixup in example in [temp.variadic] to match the normative wording.</p>
<h4 id="lwg-motion-10">LWG motion 10</h4>
<p>LWG2408: Add a wording change from N3843’s “Common wording” that was not included in the library issue applying N3843 to the standard. This change has no normative effect but removes the appearance of inconsistency. Also reword this change and some of the other wording changes in this issue for clarity.</p>
<h4 id="lwg-motion-11">LWG motion 11</h4>
<p>LWG2361, LWG2387: Format <em>qualified-id</em> as a grammar term.</p>
<h4 id="lwg-motion-12">LWG motion 12</h4>
<p>Update Annex C’s existing mentions of <code>unary_function</code> and <code>binary_function</code> to clarify that they no longer exist.</p>
<h4 id="lwg-motion-14">LWG motion 14</h4>
<p>Changes to [unique.ptr.runtime.modifiers] removed text that was not present; in the first paragraph, the only applied change was the insertion of a default argument. This makes the standard match the described “after” state.</p>
<h4 id="lwg-motion-16">LWG motion 16</h4>
<p>[unord.set.overview], [unord.multiset.overview]: Replace meaningless “Container_move_assign” with the intended “Pred”.</p>
<h3 id="other-notable-editorial-changes">Other Notable Editorial Changes:</h3>
<p>Added new subclause [diff.cpp14] (C.4) for compatibility differences between the working draft and ISO C++14.</p>
