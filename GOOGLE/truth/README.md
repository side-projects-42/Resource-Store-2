What is Truth?
--------------

Truth makes your [test assertions](https://truth.dev/benefits#readable-assertions) and [failure messages](https://truth.dev/benefits#readable-messages) more readable. [Similar](https://truth.dev/comparison) to [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/), it [natively supports](https://truth.dev/known_types) many JDK and [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) types, and it is [extensible](https://truth.dev/extension) to others.

Truth is owned and maintained by the [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) team. It is used in the majority of the tests in Googleâ€™s own codebase.
