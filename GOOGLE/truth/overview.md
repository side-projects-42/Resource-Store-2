[Truth](https://truth.dev) is a library for performing assertions in tests:

    {@code
    assertThat(notificationText).contains("testuser@google.com");
    }

Truth is owned and maintained by the [Guava](http://github.com/google/guava) team. It is used in the majority of the tests in Googleâ€™s own codebase.
