jsDAV
=====

jsDAV allows you to easily add WebDAV support to a NodeJS application. jsDAV is meant to cover the entire standard, and attempts to allow integration using an easy to understand API.

SabreDAV
--------

jsDAV started as a port of [SabreDAV](http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/) to NodeJS Javascript, written by Evert Pot and maintained by Evert and contributors. [SabreDAV](http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/) is regarded as one of the highest quality WebDAV implementations around and is written entirely in PHP and is the most feature complete implementation that I’ve seen to date. I am watching the [SabreDAV](http://code.google.com/p/sabredav/) repository closely for changes, improvements and bugfixes, to see if they can be ported to jsDAV.
