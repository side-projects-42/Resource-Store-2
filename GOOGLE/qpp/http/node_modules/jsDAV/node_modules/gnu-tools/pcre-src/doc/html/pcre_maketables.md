**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**const unsigned char \*pcre\_maketables(void);**

**const unsigned char \*pcre16\_maketables(void);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This function builds a set of character tables for character values less than 256. These can be passed to **pcre\[16\]\_compile()** to override PCREâ€™s internal, built-in tables (which were made by **pcre\[16\]\_maketables()** when PCRE was compiled). You might want to do this if you are using a non-standard locale. The function yields a pointer to the tables.

There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the [**pcreapi**](pcreapi.html) page and a description of the POSIX API in the [**pcreposix**](pcreposix.html) page.
