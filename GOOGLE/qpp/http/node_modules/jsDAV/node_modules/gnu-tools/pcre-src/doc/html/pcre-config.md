**pcre-config \[–prefix\] \[–exec-prefix\] \[–version\] \[–libs\]** **\[–libs16\] \[–libs-cpp\] \[–libs-posix\] \[–cflags\]** **\[–cflags-posix\]**

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC2">DESCRIPTION</a>

**pcre-config** returns the configuration of the installed PCRE libraries and the options required to compile a program to use them. Some of the options apply only to the 8-bit or 16-bit libraries, respectively, and are not available if only one of those libraries has been built. If an unavailable option is encountered, the “usage” information is output.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC3">OPTIONS</a>

**–prefix** Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for architecture independent files (*/usr* on many systems, */usr/local* on some systems) to the standard output.

**–exec-prefix** Writes the directory prefix used in the PCRE installation for architecture dependent files (normally the same as **–prefix**) to the standard output.

**–version** Writes the version number of the installed PCRE libraries to the standard output.

**–libs** Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link with the 8-bit PCRE library (**-lpcre** on many systems).

**–libs16** Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link with the 16-bit PCRE library (**-lpcre16** on many systems).

**–libs-cpp** Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link with PCRE’s C++ wrapper library (**-lpcrecpp** **-lpcre** on many systems).

**–libs-posix** Writes to the standard output the command line options required to link with PCRE’s POSIX API wrapper library (**-lpcreposix** **-lpcre** on many systems).

**–cflags** Writes to the standard output the command line options required to compile files that use PCRE (this may include some **-I** options, but is blank on many systems).

**–cflags-posix** Writes to the standard output the command line options required to compile files that use PCRE’s POSIX API wrapper library (this may include some **-I** options, but is blank on many systems).
