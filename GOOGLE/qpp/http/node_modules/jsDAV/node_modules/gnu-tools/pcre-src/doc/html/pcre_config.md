**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**int pcre\_config(int *what*, void \**where*);**

**int pcre16\_config(int *what*, void \**where*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This function makes it possible for a client program to find out which optional features are available in the version of the PCRE library it is using. The arguments are as follows:

      what     A code specifying what information is required
      where    Points to where to put the data

The *where* argument must point to an integer variable, except for PCRE\_CONFIG\_MATCH\_LIMIT and PCRE\_CONFIG\_MATCH\_LIMIT\_RECURSION, when it must point to an unsigned long integer. The available codes are:

      PCRE_CONFIG_JIT           Availability of just-in-time compiler
                                  support (1=yes 0=no)
      PCRE_CONFIG_JITTARGET     String containing information about the
                                  target architecture for the JIT compiler,
                                  or NULL if there is no JIT support
      PCRE_CONFIG_LINK_SIZE     Internal link size: 2, 3, or 4
      PCRE_CONFIG_MATCH_LIMIT   Internal resource limit
      PCRE_CONFIG_MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION
                                Internal recursion depth limit
      PCRE_CONFIG_NEWLINE       Value of the default newline sequence:
                                    13 (0x000d)    for CR
                                    10 (0x000a)    for LF
                                  3338 (0x0d0a)    for CRLF
                                    -2             for ANYCRLF
                                    -1             for ANY
      PCRE_CONFIG_BSR           Indicates what \R matches by default:
                                     0             all Unicode line endings
                                     1             CR, LF, or CRLF only
      PCRE_CONFIG_POSIX_MALLOC_THRESHOLD
                                Threshold of return slots, above which
                                  malloc() is used by the POSIX API
      PCRE_CONFIG_STACKRECURSE  Recursion implementation (1=stack 0=heap)
      PCRE_CONFIG_UTF16         Availability of UTF-16 support (1=yes
                                   0=no); option for pcre16_config()
      PCRE_CONFIG_UTF8          Availability of UTF-8 support (1=yes 0=no);
                                  option for pcre_config()
      PCRE_CONFIG_UNICODE_PROPERTIES
                                Availability of Unicode property support
                                  (1=yes 0=no)

The function yields 0 on success or PCRE\_ERROR\_BADOPTION otherwise. That error is also given if PCRE\_CONFIG\_UTF16 is passed to **pcre\_config()** or if PCRE\_CONFIG\_UTF8 is passed to **pcre16\_config()**.
