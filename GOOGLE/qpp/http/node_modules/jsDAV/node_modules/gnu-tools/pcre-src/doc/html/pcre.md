<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC1">INTRODUCTION</a>

The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl, with just a few differences. Some features that appeared in Python and PCRE before they appeared in Perl are also available using the Python syntax, there is some support for one or two .NET and Oniguruma syntax items, and there is an option for requesting some minor changes that give better JavaScript compatibility.

Starting with release 8.30, it is possible to compile two separate PCRE libraries: the original, which supports 8-bit character strings (including UTF-8 strings), and a second library that supports 16-bit character strings (including UTF-16 strings). The build process allows either one or both to be built. The majority of the work to make this possible was done by Zoltan Herczeg.

The two libraries contain identical sets of functions, except that the names in the 16-bit library start with **pcre16\_** instead of **pcre\_**. To avoid over-complication and reduce the documentation maintenance load, most of the documentation describes the 8-bit library, with the differences for the 16-bit library described separately in the [**pcre16**](pcre16.html) page. References to functions or structures of the form *pcre\[16\]\_xxx* should be read as meaning “*pcre\_xxx* when using the 8-bit library and *pcre16\_xxx* when using the 16-bit library”.

The current implementation of PCRE corresponds approximately with Perl 5.12, including support for UTF-8/16 encoded strings and Unicode general category properties. However, UTF-8/16 and Unicode support has to be explicitly enabled; it is not the default. The Unicode tables correspond to Unicode release 6.0.0.

In addition to the Perl-compatible matching function, PCRE contains an alternative function that matches the same compiled patterns in a different way. In certain circumstances, the alternative function has some advantages. For a discussion of the two matching algorithms, see the [**pcrematching**](pcrematching.html) page.

PCRE is written in C and released as a C library. A number of people have written wrappers and interfaces of various kinds. In particular, Google Inc. have provided a comprehensive C++ wrapper for the 8-bit library. This is now included as part of the PCRE distribution. The [**pcrecpp**](pcrecpp.html) page has details of this interface. Other people’s contributions can be found in the *Contrib* directory at the primary FTP site, which is: <a href="ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre" class="uri">ftp://ftp.csx.cam.ac.uk/pub/software/programming/pcre</a>

Details of exactly which Perl regular expression features are and are not supported by PCRE are given in separate documents. See the [**pcrepattern**](pcrepattern.html) and [**pcrecompat**](pcrecompat.html) pages. There is a syntax summary in the [**pcresyntax**](pcresyntax.html) page.

Some features of PCRE can be included, excluded, or changed when the library is built. The [**pcre\_config()**](pcre_config.html) function makes it possible for a client to discover which features are available. The features themselves are described in the [**pcrebuild**](pcrebuild.html) page. Documentation about building PCRE for various operating systems can be found in the **README** and **NON-UNIX-USE** files in the source distribution.

The libraries contains a number of undocumented internal functions and data tables that are used by more than one of the exported external functions, but which are not intended for use by external callers. Their names all begin with “\_pcre\_” or “\_pcre16\_”, which hopefully will not provoke any name clashes. In some environments, it is possible to control which external symbols are exported when a shared library is built, and in these cases the undocumented symbols are not exported.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC2">USER DOCUMENTATION</a>

The user documentation for PCRE comprises a number of different sections. In the “man” format, each of these is a separate “man page”. In the HTML format, each is a separate page, linked from the index page. In the plain text format, all the sections, except the **pcredemo** section, are concatenated, for ease of searching. The sections are as follows:

      pcre              this document
      pcre16            details of the 16-bit library
      pcre-config       show PCRE installation configuration information
      pcreapi           details of PCRE's native C API
      pcrebuild         options for building PCRE
      pcrecallout       details of the callout feature
      pcrecompat        discussion of Perl compatibility
      pcrecpp           details of the C++ wrapper for the 8-bit library
      pcredemo          a demonstration C program that uses PCRE
      pcregrep          description of the pcregrep command (8-bit only)
      pcrejit           discussion of the just-in-time optimization support
      pcrelimits        details of size and other limits
      pcrematching      discussion of the two matching algorithms
      pcrepartial       details of the partial matching facility
      pcrepattern       syntax and semantics of supported regular expressions
      pcreperform       discussion of performance issues
      pcreposix         the POSIX-compatible C API for the 8-bit library
      pcreprecompile    details of saving and re-using precompiled patterns
      pcresample        discussion of the pcredemo program
      pcrestack         discussion of stack usage
      pcresyntax        quick syntax reference
      pcretest          description of the pcretest testing command
      pcreunicode       discussion of Unicode and UTF-8/16 support

In addition, in the “man” and HTML formats, there is a short page for each 8-bit C library function, listing its arguments and results.
