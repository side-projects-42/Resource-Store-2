**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**pcre\_jit\_stack \*pcre\_jit\_stack\_alloc(int *startsize*,** **int *maxsize*);**

**pcre16\_jit\_stack \*pcre16\_jit\_stack\_alloc(int *startsize*,** **int *maxsize*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This function is used to create a stack for use by the code compiled by the JIT optimization of **pcre\[16\]\_study()**. The arguments are a starting size for the stack, and a maximum size to which it is allowed to grow. The result can be passed to the JIT runtime code by **pcre\[16\]\_assign\_jit\_stack()**, or that function can set up a callback for obtaining a stack. A maximum stack size of 512K to 1M should be more than enough for any pattern. For more details, see the [**pcrejit**](pcrejit.html) page.

There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the [**pcreapi**](pcreapi.html) page and a description of the POSIX API in the [**pcreposix**](pcreposix.html) page.
