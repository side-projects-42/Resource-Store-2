**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**int pcre\_copy\_named\_substring(const pcre \**code*,** **const char \**subject*, int \**ovector*,** **int *stringcount*, const char \**stringname*,** **char \**buffer*, int *buffersize*);**

**int pcre16\_copy\_named\_substring(const pcre16 \**code*,** **PCRE\_SPTR16 *subject*, int \**ovector*,** **int *stringcount*, PCRE\_SPTR16 *stringname*,** **PCRE\_UCHAR16 \**buffer*, int *buffersize*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This is a convenience function for extracting a captured substring, identified by name, into a given buffer. The arguments are:

      code          Pattern that was successfully matched
      subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
      ovector       Offset vector that pcre[16]_exec() used
      stringcount   Value returned by pcre[16]_exec()
      stringname    Name of the required substring
      buffer        Buffer to receive the string
      buffersize    Size of buffer

The yield is the length of the substring, PCRE\_ERROR\_NOMEMORY if the buffer was too small, or PCRE\_ERROR\_NOSUBSTRING if the string name is invalid.

There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the [**pcreapi**](pcreapi.html) page and a description of the POSIX API in the [**pcreposix**](pcreposix.html) page.
