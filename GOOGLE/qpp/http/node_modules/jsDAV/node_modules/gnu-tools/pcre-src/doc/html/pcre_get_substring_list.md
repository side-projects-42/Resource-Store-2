**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**int pcre\_get\_substring\_list(const char \**subject*,** **int \**ovector*, int *stringcount*, const char \*\*\**listptr*);**

**int pcre16\_get\_substring\_list(PCRE\_SPTR16 *subject*,** **int \**ovector*, int *stringcount*, PCRE\_SPTR16 \*\**listptr*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This is a convenience function for extracting a list of all the captured substrings. The arguments are:

      subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
      ovector       Offset vector that pcre[16]_exec used
      stringcount   Value returned by pcre[16]_exec
      listptr       Where to put a pointer to the list

The memory in which the substrings and the list are placed is obtained by calling **pcre\[16\]\_malloc()**. The convenience function **pcre\[16\]\_free\_substring\_list()** can be used to free it when it is no longer needed. A pointer to a list of pointers is put in the variable whose address is in *listptr*. The list is terminated by a NULL pointer. The yield of the function is zero on success or PCRE\_ERROR\_NOMEMORY if sufficient memory could not be obtained.

There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the [**pcreapi**](pcreapi.html) page and a description of the POSIX API in the [**pcreposix**](pcreposix.html) page.
