**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**void pcre\_assign\_jit\_stack(pcre\_extra \**extra*,** **pcre\_jit\_callback *callback*, void \**data*);**

**void pcre16\_assign\_jit\_stack(pcre16\_extra \**extra*,** **pcre16\_jit\_callback *callback*, void \**data*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This function provides control over the memory used as a stack at runtime by a call to **pcre\[16\]\_exec()** with a pattern that has been successfully compiled with JIT optimization. The arguments are:

      extra     the data pointer returned by pcre[16]_study()
      callback  a callback function
      data      a JIT stack or a value to be passed to the callback
                  function

If *callback* is NULL and *data* is NULL, an internal 32K block on the machine stack is used.

If *callback* is NULL and *data* is not NULL, *data* must be a valid JIT stack, the result of calling **pcre\[16\]\_jit\_stack\_alloc()**.

If *callback* not NULL, it is called with *data* as an argument at the start of matching, in order to set up a JIT stack. If the result is NULL, the internal 32K stack is used; otherwise the return value must be a valid JIT stack, the result of calling **pcre\[16\]\_jit\_stack\_alloc()**.

You may safely assign the same JIT stack to multiple patterns, as long as they are all matched in the same thread. In a multithread application, each thread must use its own JIT stack. For more details, see the [**pcrejit**](pcrejit.html) page.

There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the [**pcreapi**](pcreapi.html) page and a description of the POSIX API in the [**pcreposix**](pcreposix.html) page.
