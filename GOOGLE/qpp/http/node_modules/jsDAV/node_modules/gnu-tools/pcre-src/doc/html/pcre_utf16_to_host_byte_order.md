**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**int pcre16\_utf16\_to\_host\_byte\_order(PCRE\_UCHAR16 \**output*,** **PCRE\_SPTR16 *input*, int *length*, int \**host\_byte\_order*,** **int *keep\_boms*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This function, which exists only in the 16-bit library, converts a UTF-16 string to the correct order for the current host, taking account of any byte order marks (BOMs) within the string. Its arguments are:

      output           pointer to output buffer, may be the same as input
      input            pointer to input buffer
      length           number of 16-bit units in the input, or negative for
                         a zero-terminated string
      host_byte_order  a NULL value or a non-zero value pointed to means
                         start in host byte order
      keep_boms        if non-zero, BOMs are copied to the output string

The result of the function is the number of 16-bit units placed into the output buffer, including the zero terminator if the string was zero-terminated.

If *host\_byte\_order* is not NULL, it is set to indicate the byte order that is current at the end of the string.
