**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**int pcre\_pattern\_to\_host\_byte\_order(pcre \**code*,** **pcre\_extra \**extra*, const unsigned char \**tables*);**

**int pcre16\_pattern\_to\_host\_byte\_order(pcre16 \**code*,** **pcre16\_extra \**extra*, const unsigned char \**tables*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This function ensures that the bytes in 2-byte and 4-byte values in a compiled pattern are in the correct order for the current host. It is useful when a pattern that has been compiled on one host is transferred to another that might have different endianness. The arguments are:

      code         A compiled regular expression
      extra        Points to an associated pcre[16]_extra structure,
                     or is NULL
      tables       Pointer to character tables, or NULL to
                     set the built-in default

The result is 0 for success, a negative PCRE\_ERROR\_xxx value otherwise.
