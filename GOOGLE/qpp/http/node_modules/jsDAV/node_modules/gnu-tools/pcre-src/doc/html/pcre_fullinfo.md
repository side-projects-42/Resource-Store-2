**DESCRIPTION**

This function returns information about a compiled pattern. Its arguments are:

      code                      Compiled regular expression
      extra                     Result of pcre[16]_study() or NULL
      what                      What information is required
      where                     Where to put the information

The following information is available:

      PCRE_INFO_BACKREFMAX      Number of highest back reference
      PCRE_INFO_CAPTURECOUNT    Number of capturing subpatterns
      PCRE_INFO_DEFAULT_TABLES  Pointer to default tables
      PCRE_INFO_FIRSTBYTE       Fixed first data unit for a match, or
                                  -1 for start of string
                                     or after newline, or
                                  -2 otherwise
      PCRE_INFO_FIRSTTABLE      Table of first data units (after studying)
      PCRE_INFO_HASCRORLF       Return 1 if explicit CR or LF matches exist
      PCRE_INFO_JCHANGED        Return 1 if (?J) or (?-J) was used
      PCRE_INFO_JIT             Return 1 after successful JIT compilation
      PCRE_INFO_JITSIZE         Size of JIT compiled code
      PCRE_INFO_LASTLITERAL     Literal last data unit required
      PCRE_INFO_MINLENGTH       Lower bound length of matching strings
      PCRE_INFO_NAMECOUNT       Number of named subpatterns
      PCRE_INFO_NAMEENTRYSIZE   Size of name table entry
      PCRE_INFO_NAMETABLE       Pointer to name table
      PCRE_INFO_OKPARTIAL       Return 1 if partial matching can be tried
                                  (always returns 1 after release 8.00)
      PCRE_INFO_OPTIONS         Option bits used for compilation
      PCRE_INFO_SIZE            Size of compiled pattern
      PCRE_INFO_STUDYSIZE       Size of study data

The *where* argument must point to an integer variable, except for the following *what* values:

      PCRE_INFO_DEFAULT_TABLES  const unsigned char *
      PCRE_INFO_FIRSTTABLE      const unsigned char *
      PCRE_INFO_NAMETABLE       PCRE_SPTR16           (16-bit library)
      PCRE_INFO_NAMETABLE       const unsigned char * (8-bit library)
      PCRE_INFO_OPTIONS         unsigned long int
      PCRE_INFO_SIZE            size_t

The yield of the function is zero on success or:

      PCRE_ERROR_NULL           the argument code was NULL
                                the argument where was NULL
      PCRE_ERROR_BADMAGIC       the "magic number" was not found
      PCRE_ERROR_BADOPTION      the value of what was invalid
