**SYNOPSIS**

**\#include &lt;pcre.h&gt;**

**pcre \*pcre\_compile(const char \**pattern*, int *options*,** **const char \*\**errptr*, int \**erroffset*,** **const unsigned char \**tableptr*);**

**pcre16 \*pcre16\_compile(PCRE\_SPTR16 *pattern*, int *options*,** **const char \*\**errptr*, int \**erroffset*,** **const unsigned char \**tableptr*);**

**DESCRIPTION**

This function compiles a regular expression into an internal form. It is the same as **pcre\[16\]\_compile2()**, except for the absence of the *errorcodeptr* argument. Its arguments are:

      pattern       A zero-terminated string containing the
                      regular expression to be compiled
      options       Zero or more option bits
      errptr        Where to put an error message
      erroffset     Offset in pattern where error was found
      tableptr      Pointer to character tables, or NULL to
                      use the built-in default

The option bits are:

      PCRE_ANCHORED           Force pattern anchoring
      PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT       Compile automatic callouts
      PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF        \R matches only CR, LF, or CRLF
      PCRE_BSR_UNICODE        \R matches all Unicode line endings
      PCRE_CASELESS           Do caseless matching
      PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY     $ not to match newline at end
      PCRE_DOTALL             . matches anything including NL
      PCRE_DUPNAMES           Allow duplicate names for subpatterns
      PCRE_EXTENDED           Ignore whitespace and # comments
      PCRE_EXTRA              PCRE extra features
                                (not much use currently)
      PCRE_FIRSTLINE          Force matching to be before newline
      PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT  JavaScript compatibility
      PCRE_MULTILINE          ^ and $ match newlines within data
      PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY        Recognize any Unicode newline sequence
      PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF    Recognize CR, LF, and CRLF as newline
                                sequences
      PCRE_NEWLINE_CR         Set CR as the newline sequence
      PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF       Set CRLF as the newline sequence
      PCRE_NEWLINE_LF         Set LF as the newline sequence
      PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE    Disable numbered capturing paren-
                                theses (named ones available)
      PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK     Do not check the pattern for UTF-16
                                validity (only relevant if
                                PCRE_UTF16 is set)
      PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK      Do not check the pattern for UTF-8
                                validity (only relevant if
                                PCRE_UTF8 is set)
      PCRE_UCP                Use Unicode properties for \d, \w, etc.
      PCRE_UNGREEDY           Invert greediness of quantifiers
      PCRE_UTF16              Run in pcre16_compile() UTF-16 mode
      PCRE_UTF8               Run in pcre_compile() UTF-8 mode

PCRE must be built with UTF support in order to use PCRE\_UTF8/16 and PCRE\_NO\_UTF8/16\_CHECK, and with UCP support if PCRE\_UCP is used.

The yield of the function is a pointer to a private data structure that contains the compiled pattern, or NULL if an error was detected. Note that compiling regular expressions with one version of PCRE for use with a different version is not guaranteed to work and may cause crashes.
