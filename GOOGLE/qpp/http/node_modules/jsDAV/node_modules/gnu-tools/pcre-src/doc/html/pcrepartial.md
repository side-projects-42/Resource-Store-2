<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC1">PARTIAL MATCHING IN PCRE</a>

In normal use of PCRE, if the subject string that is passed to a matching function matches as far as it goes, but is too short to match the entire pattern, PCRE\_ERROR\_NOMATCH is returned. There are circumstances where it might be helpful to distinguish this case from other cases in which there is no match.

Consider, for example, an application where a human is required to type in data for a field with specific formatting requirements. An example might be a date in the form *ddmmmyy*, defined by this pattern:

      ^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$

If the application sees the user’s keystrokes one by one, and can check that what has been typed so far is potentially valid, it is able to raise an error as soon as a mistake is made, by beeping and not reflecting the character that has been typed, for example. This immediate feedback is likely to be a better user interface than a check that is delayed until the entire string has been entered. Partial matching can also be useful when the subject string is very long and is not all available at once.

PCRE supports partial matching by means of the PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT and PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD options, which can be set when calling any of the matching functions. For backwards compatibility, PCRE\_PARTIAL is a synonym for PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT. The essential difference between the two options is whether or not a partial match is preferred to an alternative complete match, though the details differ between the two types of matching function. If both options are set, PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD takes precedence.

Setting a partial matching option disables the use of any just-in-time code that was set up by studying the compiled pattern with the PCRE\_STUDY\_JIT\_COMPILE option. It also disables two of PCRE’s standard optimizations. PCRE remembers the last literal data unit in a pattern, and abandons matching immediately if it is not present in the subject string. This optimization cannot be used for a subject string that might match only partially. If the pattern was studied, PCRE knows the minimum length of a matching string, and does not bother to run the matching function on shorter strings. This optimization is also disabled for partial matching.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC2">PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_exec() OR pcre16_exec()</a>

A partial match occurs during a call to **pcre\_exec()** or **pcre16\_exec()** when the end of the subject string is reached successfully, but matching cannot continue because more characters are needed. However, at least one character in the subject must have been inspected. This character need not form part of the final matched string; lookbehind assertions and the \\K escape sequence provide ways of inspecting characters before the start of a matched substring. The requirement for inspecting at least one character exists because an empty string can always be matched; without such a restriction there would always be a partial match of an empty string at the end of the subject.

If there are at least two slots in the offsets vector when a partial match is returned, the first slot is set to the offset of the earliest character that was inspected. For convenience, the second offset points to the end of the subject so that a substring can easily be identified.

For the majority of patterns, the first offset identifies the start of the partially matched string. However, for patterns that contain lookbehind assertions, or \\K, or begin with \\b or \\B, earlier characters have been inspected while carrying out the match. For example:

      /(?<=abc)123/

This pattern matches “123”, but only if it is preceded by “abc”. If the subject string is “xyzabc12”, the offsets after a partial match are for the substring “abc12”, because all these characters are needed if another match is tried with extra characters added to the subject.

What happens when a partial match is identified depends on which of the two partial matching options are set.

**PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT WITH pcre\_exec() OR pcre16\_exec()**

If PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT is set when **pcre\_exec()** or **pcre16\_exec()** identifies a partial match, the partial match is remembered, but matching continues as normal, and other alternatives in the pattern are tried. If no complete match can be found, PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL is returned instead of PCRE\_ERROR\_NOMATCH.

This option is “soft” because it prefers a complete match over a partial match. All the various matching items in a pattern behave as if the subject string is potentially complete. For example, \\z, \\Z, and $ match at the end of the subject, as normal, and for \\b and \\B the end of the subject is treated as a non-alphanumeric.

If there is more than one partial match, the first one that was found provides the data that is returned. Consider this pattern:

      /123\w+X|dogY/

If this is matched against the subject string “abc123dog”, both alternatives fail to match, but the end of the subject is reached during matching, so PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL is returned. The offsets are set to 3 and 9, identifying “123dog” as the first partial match that was found. (In this example, there are two partial matches, because “dog” on its own partially matches the second alternative.)

**PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD WITH pcre\_exec() OR pcre16\_exec()**

If PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD is set for **pcre\_exec()** or **pcre16\_exec()**, PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL is returned as soon as a partial match is found, without continuing to search for possible complete matches. This option is “hard” because it prefers an earlier partial match over a later complete match. For this reason, the assumption is made that the end of the supplied subject string may not be the true end of the available data, and so, if \\z, \\Z, \\b, \\B, or $ are encountered at the end of the subject, the result is PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL, provided that at least one character in the subject has been inspected.

Setting PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD also affects the way UTF-8 and UTF-16 subject strings are checked for validity. Normally, an invalid sequence causes the error PCRE\_ERROR\_BADUTF8 or PCRE\_ERROR\_BADUTF16. However, in the special case of a truncated character at the end of the subject, PCRE\_ERROR\_SHORTUTF8 or PCRE\_ERROR\_SHORTUTF16 is returned when PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD is set.

**Comparing hard and soft partial matching**

The difference between the two partial matching options can be illustrated by a pattern such as:

      /dog(sbody)?/

This matches either “dog” or “dogsbody”, greedily (that is, it prefers the longer string if possible). If it is matched against the string “dog” with PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT, it yields a complete match for “dog”. However, if PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD is set, the result is PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL. On the other hand, if the pattern is made ungreedy the result is different:

      /dog(sbody)??/

In this case the result is always a complete match because that is found first, and matching never continues after finding a complete match. It might be easier to follow this explanation by thinking of the two patterns like this:

      /dog(sbody)?/    is the same as  /dogsbody|dog/
      /dog(sbody)??/   is the same as  /dog|dogsbody/

The second pattern will never match “dogsbody”, because it will always find the shorter match first.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC3">PARTIAL MATCHING USING pcre_dfa_exec() OR pcre16_dfa_exec()</a>

The DFA functions move along the subject string character by character, without backtracking, searching for all possible matches simultaneously. If the end of the subject is reached before the end of the pattern, there is the possibility of a partial match, again provided that at least one character has been inspected.

When PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT is set, PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL is returned only if there have been no complete matches. Otherwise, the complete matches are returned. However, if PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD is set, a partial match takes precedence over any complete matches. The portion of the string that was inspected when the longest partial match was found is set as the first matching string, provided there are at least two slots in the offsets vector.

Because the DFA functions always search for all possible matches, and there is no difference between greedy and ungreedy repetition, their behaviour is different from the standard functions when PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD is set. Consider the string “dog” matched against the ungreedy pattern shown above:

      /dog(sbody)??/

Whereas the standard functions stop as soon as they find the complete match for “dog”, the DFA functions also find the partial match for “dogsbody”, and so return that when PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD is set.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC4">PARTIAL MATCHING AND WORD BOUNDARIES</a>

If a pattern ends with one of sequences \\b or \\B, which test for word boundaries, partial matching with PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT can give counter-intuitive results. Consider this pattern:

      /\bcat\b/

This matches “cat”, provided there is a word boundary at either end. If the subject string is “the cat”, the comparison of the final “t” with a following character cannot take place, so a partial match is found. However, normal matching carries on, and \\b matches at the end of the subject when the last character is a letter, so a complete match is found. The result, therefore, is *not* PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL. Using PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD in this case does yield PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL, because then the partial match takes precedence.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC5">FORMERLY RESTRICTED PATTERNS</a>

For releases of PCRE prior to 8.00, because of the way certain internal optimizations were implemented in the **pcre\_exec()** function, the PCRE\_PARTIAL option (predecessor of PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT) could not be used with all patterns. From release 8.00 onwards, the restrictions no longer apply, and partial matching with can be requested for any pattern.

Items that were formerly restricted were repeated single characters and repeated metasequences. If PCRE\_PARTIAL was set for a pattern that did not conform to the restrictions, **pcre\_exec()** returned the error code PCRE\_ERROR\_BADPARTIAL (-13). This error code is no longer in use. The PCRE\_INFO\_OKPARTIAL call to **pcre\_fullinfo()** to find out if a compiled pattern can be used for partial matching now always returns 1.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC6">EXAMPLE OF PARTIAL MATCHING USING PCRETEST</a>

If the escape sequence \\P is present in a **pcretest** data line, the PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT option is used for the match. Here is a run of **pcretest** that uses the date example quoted above:

        re> /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
      data> 25jun04\P
       0: 25jun04
       1: jun
      data> 25dec3\P
      Partial match: 23dec3
      data> 3ju\P
      Partial match: 3ju
      data> 3juj\P
      No match
      data> j\P
      No match

The first data string is matched completely, so **pcretest** shows the matched substrings. The remaining four strings do not match the complete pattern, but the first two are partial matches. Similar output is obtained if DFA matching is used.

If the escape sequence \\P is present more than once in a **pcretest** data line, the PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD option is set for the match.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC7">MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_dfa_exec() OR pcre16_dfa_exec()</a>

When a partial match has been found using a DFA matching function, it is possible to continue the match by providing additional subject data and calling the function again with the same compiled regular expression, this time setting the PCRE\_DFA\_RESTART option. You must pass the same working space as before, because this is where details of the previous partial match are stored. Here is an example using **pcretest**, using the \\R escape sequence to set the PCRE\_DFA\_RESTART option (\\D specifies the use of the DFA matching function):

        re> /^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$/
      data> 23ja\P\D
      Partial match: 23ja
      data> n05\R\D
       0: n05

The first call has “23ja” as the subject, and requests partial matching; the second call has “n05” as the subject for the continued (restarted) match. Notice that when the match is complete, only the last part is shown; PCRE does not retain the previously partially-matched string. It is up to the calling program to do that if it needs to.

You can set the PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT or PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD options with PCRE\_DFA\_RESTART to continue partial matching over multiple segments. This facility can be used to pass very long subject strings to the DFA matching functions.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC8">MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING WITH pcre_exec() OR pcre16_exec()</a>

From release 8.00, the standard matching functions can also be used to do multi-segment matching. Unlike the DFA functions, it is not possible to restart the previous match with a new segment of data. Instead, new data must be added to the previous subject string, and the entire match re-run, starting from the point where the partial match occurred. Earlier data can be discarded.

It is best to use PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD in this situation, because it does not treat the end of a segment as the end of the subject when matching \\z, \\Z, \\b, \\B, and $. Consider an unanchored pattern that matches dates:

        re> /\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d/
      data> The date is 23ja\P\P
      Partial match: 23ja

At this stage, an application could discard the text preceding “23ja”, add on text from the next segment, and call the matching function again. Unlike the DFA matching functions the entire matching string must always be available, and the complete matching process occurs for each call, so more memory and more processing time is needed.

**Note:** If the pattern contains lookbehind assertions, or \\K, or starts with \\b or \\B, the string that is returned for a partial match includes characters that precede the partially matched string itself, because these must be retained when adding on more characters for a subsequent matching attempt.

<a href="#TOC1" id="SEC9">ISSUES WITH MULTI-SEGMENT MATCHING</a>

Certain types of pattern may give problems with multi-segment matching, whichever matching function is used.

1.  If the pattern contains a test for the beginning of a line, you need to pass the PCRE\_NOTBOL option when the subject string for any call does start at the beginning of a line. There is also a PCRE\_NOTEOL option, but in practice when doing multi-segment matching you should be using PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD, which includes the effect of PCRE\_NOTEOL.

2.  Lookbehind assertions at the start of a pattern are catered for in the offsets that are returned for a partial match. However, in theory, a lookbehind assertion later in the pattern could require even earlier characters to be inspected, and it might not have been reached when a partial match occurs. This is probably an extremely unlikely case; you could guard against it to a certain extent by always including extra characters at the start.

3.  Matching a subject string that is split into multiple segments may not always produce exactly the same result as matching over one single long string, especially when PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT is used. The section “Partial Matching and Word Boundaries” above describes an issue that arises if the pattern ends with \\b or \\B. Another kind of difference may occur when there are multiple matching possibilities, because (for PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT) a partial match result is given only when there are no completed matches. This means that as soon as the shortest match has been found, continuation to a new subject segment is no longer possible. Consider again this **pcretest** example:

         re> /dog(sbody)?/

    data&gt; dogsb 0: dog data&gt; do Partial match: do data&gt; gsb 0: g data&gt; dogsbody 0: dogsbody 1: dog

The first data line passes the string “dogsb” to a standard matching function, setting the PCRE\_PARTIAL\_SOFT option. Although the string is a partial match for “dogsbody”, the result is not PCRE\_ERROR\_PARTIAL, because the shorter string “dog” is a complete match. Similarly, when the subject is presented to a DFA matching function in several parts (“do” and “gsb” being the first two) the match stops when “dog” has been found, and it is not possible to continue. On the other hand, if “dogsbody” is presented as a single string, a DFA matching function finds both matches.

Because of these problems, it is best to use PCRE\_PARTIAL\_HARD when matching multi-segment data. The example above then behaves differently:

        re> /dog(sbody)?/
      data> dogsb\P\P
      Partial match: dogsb
      data> do\P\D
      Partial match: do
      data> gsb\R\P\P\D
      Partial match: gsb

1.  Patterns that contain alternatives at the top level which do not all start with the same pattern item may not work as expected when PCRE\_DFA\_RESTART is used. For example, consider this pattern:

    1234|3789

If the first part of the subject is “ABC123”, a partial match of the first alternative is found at offset 3. There is no partial match for the second alternative, because such a match does not start at the same point in the subject string. Attempting to continue with the string “7890” does not yield a match because only those alternatives that match at one point in the subject are remembered. The problem arises because the start of the second alternative matches within the first alternative. There is no problem with anchored patterns or patterns such as:

      1234|ABCD

where no string can be a partial match for both alternatives. This is not a problem if a standard matching function is used, because the entire match has to be rerun each time:

        re> /1234|3789/
      data> ABC123\P\P
      Partial match: 123
      data> 1237890
       0: 3789

Of course, instead of using PCRE\_DFA\_RESTART, the same technique of re-running the entire match can also be used with the DFA matching functions. Another possibility is to work with two buffers. If a partial match at offset *n* in the first buffer is followed by “no match” when PCRE\_DFA\_RESTART is used on the second buffer, you can then try a new match starting at offset *n+1* in the first buffer.
