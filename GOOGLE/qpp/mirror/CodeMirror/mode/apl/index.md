CodeMirror: APL mode
====================

⍝ Conway’s game of life ⍝ This example was inspired by the impressive demo at ⍝ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9xAKttWgP4 ⍝ Create a matrix: ⍝ 0 1 1 ⍝ 1 1 0 ⍝ 0 1 0 creature ← (3 3 ⍴ ⍳ 9) ∈ 1 2 3 4 7 ⍝ Original creature from demo creature ← (3 3 ⍴ ⍳ 9) ∈ 1 3 6 7 8 ⍝ Glider ⍝ Place the creature on a larger board, near the centre board ← ¯1 ⊖ ¯2 ⌽ 5 7 ↑ creature ⍝ A function to move from one generation to the next life ← {∨/ 1 ⍵ ∧ 3 4 = ⊂+/ +⌿ 1 0 ¯1 ∘.⊖ 1 0 ¯1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵} ⍝ Compute n-th generation and format it as a ⍝ character matrix gen ← {’ \#’\[(life ⍣ ⍵) board\]} ⍝ Show first three generations (gen 1) (gen 2) (gen 3)

Simple mode that tries to handle APL as well as it can.

It attempts to label functions/operators based upon monadic/dyadic usage (but this is far from fully fleshed out). This means there are meaningful classnames so hover states can have popups etc.

**MIME types defined:** `text/apl` (APL code)
