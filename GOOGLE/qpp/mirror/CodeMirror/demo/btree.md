CodeMirror: B-Tree visualization
================================

Shows a visual representation of the b-tree that CodeMirror uses to store its document. See the [corresponding blog post](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/codemirror-line-tree.html) for a description of this format. The gray blocks under each leaf show the lines it holds (with their width representing the line height). Add and remove content to see how the nodes are split and merged to keep the tree balanced.
