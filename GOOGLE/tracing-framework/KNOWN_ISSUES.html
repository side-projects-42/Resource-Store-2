<h1 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h1>
<p>This is a list of major known issues. For the latest list of all issues see the <a href="https://github.com/google/tracing-framework/issues">Github Issues page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="timing-on-chromewindows-and-ios-is-bad">Timing on Chrome/Windows and iOS is Bad</h2>
<p>Chrome/Windows does not currently implement the high-resolution timing required to get accurate times. If you try to use WTF there you’ll get very weird (and incorrect) traces. Use Chrome for Linux or OSX or another browser.</p>
<p>Chrome bug: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=158234">issue 158234</a></p>
<h2 id="timing-from-web-workers-is-bad">Timing from Web Workers is Bad</h2>
<p>Web Workers don’t currently have access to the high-resolution timing required. Spec changes are required here as well as implementations. WTF supports auto-instrumenting workers and other cool features but that’s disabled until this functionality is added to browsers. Show your support if you want it!</p>
<p>Chrome bug: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=169318">issue 169318</a></p>
<h2 id="xhr-recording-is-slow">XHR Recording is Slow</h2>
<p>The recording of XMLHttpRequest open/send/etc is currently slow. The times reported in traces will be in the 0.1-0.2ms range, however the actual times are usually an order of magnitude less than this: 0.01-0.05ms, experimentally.</p>
<p>Workaround: disable the XHR provider under the page settings to remove the overhead.</p>
<h2 id="wtf-adds-1s-to-page-load">WTF Adds ~1s to Page Load</h2>
<p>In certain browsers the DOM provider currently adds anywhere from 500ms to 1s to the page load time. This usually isn’t a problem as it won’t show up in the trace, however if you’re trying to use the window.performance values (such as navigation start) you should be aware of the additional time.</p>
<p>Workaround: disable the DOM provider under the page settings. Ideally, never measure page load timings with WTF active.</p>
<h2 id="flows-not-implemented">Flows Not Implemented</h2>
<p>The wtf.flow API is not implemented. You can emit the events but the UI will not show them.</p>
<h2 id="chrome-sad-tabs-on-windowsosx-with-large-traces">Chrome Sad Tabs on Windows/OSX with Large Traces</h2>
<p>Trying to load very large trace files (usually <code>.wtf-calls</code> files over 100MB) will often cause Chrome to sad tab. This is due to the 32-bit address space used by v8 on Windows/OSX. If you want to load large traces use a 64-bit Linux build of Chrome, which should work just fine (within reason).</p>
<p>Chrome bug: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=18323">issue 18323</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=8606">issue 8606</a></p>
