<h1 id="car-trumps">Car Trumps</h1>
<p>Car Trumps is a Windows Phone 8 example game, based on a well-known children’s card game. Basically the aim of the game is to select one property from a card in your hand (e.g., the car’s top speed) which you think can beat the opponent’s selection. This is a two player game, and requires two phones with NFC support.</p>
<p>The game starts when the players touch the phones together. A random hand is given to both players from the deck. Both players select a card from their decks. Then the other one of the players has to choose a property to compare. The comparison is executed by touching the devices together. The winner gets the opponent’s losing card. The game ends when either player runs out of cards.</p>
<p>This example application is hosted in GitHub: https://github.com/Microsoft/car-trumps</p>
<p>For more information on implementation and porting, visit Lumia Developer’s Library: http://developer.nokia.com/Resources/Library/Lumia/#!code-examples/car-trumps.html</p>
<p>This project is compatible with Windows Phone 8 and has been developed with Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Phone.</p>
<h2 id="instructions">1. Instructions</h2>
<p>To build the application you need to have Windows 8 and Windows Phone SDK 8.0 or later installed.</p>
<p>Using the Windows Phone 8 SDK:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open the SLN file: File &gt; Open Project, select the file <code>CarTrumps.sln</code></li>
<li>Select the target ‘Device’.</li>
<li>Press F5 to build the project and run it on the device.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please see the official documentation for deploying and testing applications on Windows Phone devices: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg588378%28v=vs.92%29.aspx</p>
<h2 id="implementation">2. Implementation</h2>
<p><strong>Important files and classes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>Nfc/NfcManager.cs</code>: Wrapper for the ProximityDevice. Handles submission and subscription of NFC messages. The class contains two methods used by <code>MainPage</code> and <code>GamePage</code>;
<ul>
<li><code>DealCards()</code>: Sends a DealCards message, which starts a new game. The message contains ids of opponent’s cards, and a random id, which is used to decide which player’s randomised cards are used.</li>
<li><code>ShowCard()</code>: Sends a ShowCard message. The message contains selected card id and property.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>Nfc/NfcInitiationMessage.cs</code>: This message type is used in the custom initiation protocol to decide the master/slave relationship between the two devices before the game is started.</li>
<li><code>Nfc/NfcMessage.cs</code>: Container for a NFC message, handles (de)serialization. In practice the binary message sent via NFC is a XML document.</li>
<li><code>Model/CardModel.cs</code>: Model for the pages. Contains also simple game logic; shuffling of the cards, winner decision, etc.</li>
<li><code>MainPage.xaml.cs</code>: The game starts from and ends at the main page. <code>Mainpage</code> handles the <code>DealCards</code> message, which starts a new game.</li>
<li><code>GamePage.xaml.cs</code>: The in-game page. Handles the ShowCard message. The lower part of the page consists of a Panorama holding the card properties. The top part is reserved for the car’s image.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Required capabilities:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>ID_CAP_NETWORKING</code></li>
<li><code>ID_CAP_PROXIMITY</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="known-issues">3. Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wrong card may be selected, if the touch between the phones is too weak.</li>
