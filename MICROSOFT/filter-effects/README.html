<h1 id="filter-effects">Filter Effects</h1>
<p>A Lumia example demonstrating the use of the different filters of Lumia Imaging SDK with camera photos. This example app uses the camera and displays the viewfinder for taking a picture. The taken photo is then processed with the predefined filters. The filter properties can be manipulated and the changes can be seen in the preview image immediately. The processed image can be saved in JPEG format to the device. You can also select an existing photo and apply an effect to it.</p>
<p>Two versions of this example are currently available:</p>
<ul>
<li>The universal version of the app, which can be build for and run in Windows Phone 8.1, Windows RT 8.1 and Windows 8.1 environments is located in <code>FilterEffects81</code> folder.</li>
<li>The older version, with separate code projects, supporting Windows Phone 8.0 and Windows RT 8.1 is located in <code>FilterEffectsWP80</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
