<h2 id="sqlcipher">SQLCipher</h2>
<p>SQLCipher extends the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database library to add security enhancements that make it more suitable for encrypted local data storage such as on-the-fly encryption, tamper evidence, and key derivation. Based on SQLite, SQLCipher closely tracks SQLite and periodically integrates stable SQLite release features.</p>
<p>SQLCipher is maintained by Zetetic, LLC, the official site can be found <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fast performance with as little as 5-15% overhead for encryption on many operations</li>
<li>100% of data in the database file is encrypted</li>
<li>Good security practices (CBC mode, HMAC, key derivation)</li>
<li>Zero-configuration and application level cryptography</li>
<li>Algorithms provided by the peer reviewed OpenSSL crypto library.</li>
<li>Configurable crypto providers</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<p>We welcome contributions, to contribute to SQLCipher, a <a href="https://www.zetetic.net/contributions/">contributor agreement</a> needs to be submitted. All submissions should be based on the <code>prerelease</code> branch.</p>
<h2 id="compiling">Compiling</h2>
<p>Building SQLCipher is almost the same as compiling a regular version of SQLite with two small exceptions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You <em>must</em> define <code>SQLITE_HAS_CODEC</code> and <code>SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2</code> when building sqlcipher.</li>
<li>If compiling against the default OpenSSL crypto provider, you will need to link libcrypto</li>
</ol>
<p>Example Static linking (replace /opt/local/lib with the path to libcrypto.a). Note in this example, <code>--enable-tempstore=yes</code> is setting <code>SQLITE_TEMP_STORE=2</code> for the build.</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure --enable-tempstore=yes CFLAGS=&quot;-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC&quot; \
    LDFLAGS=&quot;/opt/local/lib/libcrypto.a&quot;
$ make</code></pre>
<p>Example Dynamic linking</p>
<pre><code>$ ./configure --enable-tempstore=yes CFLAGS=&quot;-DSQLITE_HAS_CODEC&quot; \
    LDFLAGS=&quot;-lcrypto&quot;
$ make</code></pre>
<h2 id="encrypting-a-database">Encrypting a database</h2>
<p>To specify an encryption passphrase for the database via the SQL interface you use a pragma. The passphrase you enter is passed through PBKDF2 key derivation to obtain the encryption key for the database</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA key = &#39;passphrase&#39;;</code></pre>
<p>Alternately, you can specify an exact byte sequence using a blob literal. If you use this method it is your responsibility to ensure that the data you provide a 64 character hex string, which will be converted directly to 32 bytes (256 bits) of key data without key derivation.</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA key = &quot;x&#39;2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99&#39;&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>To encrypt a database programatically you can use the <code>sqlite3_key</code> function. The data provided in <code>pKey</code> is converted to an encryption key according to the same rules as <code>PRAGMA key</code>.</p>
<pre><code>int sqlite3_key(sqlite3 *db, const void *pKey, int nKey);</code></pre>
<p><code>PRAGMA key</code> or <code>sqlite3_key</code> should be called as the first operation when a database is open.</p>
<h2 id="changing-a-database-key">Changing a database key</h2>
<p>To change the encryption passphrase for an existing database you may use the rekey pragma after you’ve supplied the correct database password;</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA key = &#39;passphrase&#39;; -- start with the existing database passphrase
PRAGMA rekey = &#39;new-passphrase&#39;; -- rekey will reencrypt with the new passphrase</code></pre>
<p>The hex rekey pragma may be used to rekey to a specific binary value</p>
<pre><code>PRAGMA rekey = &quot;x&#39;2DD29CA851E7B56E4697B0E1F08507293D761A05CE4D1B628663F411A8086D99&#39;&quot;;</code></pre>
<p>This can be accomplished programtically by using sqlite3_rekey;</p>
<pre><code>sqlite3_rekey(sqlite3 *db, const void *pKey, int nKey)</code></pre>
