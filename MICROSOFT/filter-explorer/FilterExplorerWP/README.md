Instructions
------------

Make sure you have the following installed:

 * Windows 8
 * Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Phone
 * Nuget 2.7 or later

To build and run the sample in emulator

1. Open the SLN file:
   File > Open Project, select the solution (.sln postfix) file
2. Select the target 'Emulator' and platform 'x86'.
3. Press F5 to build the project and run it.

If the project does not compile on the first attempt it's possible that you
did not have the required packages yet. With Nuget 2.7 or later the missing
packages are fetched automatically when build process is invoked, so try
building again. If some packages cannot be found there should be an
error stating this in the Output panel in Visual Studio Express.
